e very morning after their own arrival at lambton these visitors came they had been walking about the place with some of their new friends and were just returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window and they saw a gentleman and lady in a curricle driving up the street elizabeth immediately recognizing the livery guessed what it meant and imparted no small degree of surprise to her relations by acquainting them with the hon

ousness      of behaviour in your       daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence though      at the same time for the consolation of yourself and mrs bennet      i am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally      bad or she could not be guilty of such an enormity at so early an      age howsoever that may be you are grievously to be pitied in      which opinion i am not only joined by mrs collins but likewise by      lady catherine and her daughter to whom i

 to have his errors made public might ruin him for ever he is now perhaps sorry for what he has done and anxious to reestablish a character we must not make him desperate  the tumult of elizabeths mind was allayed by this conversation she had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight and was certain of a willing listener in jane whenever she might wish to talk again of either but there was still something lurking behind of which prudence forbade the disclosure

that down as almost certain and immediate which she had looked forward to as possible at some future time  in revolving lady catherines expressions however she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference from what she had said of her resolution to prevent the marriage it occurred to elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew and how he might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with

 elizabeth felt that charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen she wrote cheerfully seemed surrounded with comforts and mentioned nothing which she could not praise the house furniture neighbourhood and roads were all to her taste and lady catherines behaviour was most friendly and obliging it was mr collinss picture of hunsford and rosings rationally softened and elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there to know the rest  jane had

beth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making any inquiries which jane was equally eager to satisfy after joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event which elizabeth considered as all but certain and miss bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible the former continued the subject by saying but tell me all and everything about it which i have not already heard give me further particulars what did colonel forster say had they no apprehension of anything
to marry her wickham will never marry a woman without some money he cannot afford it and what claims has lydia what attractions has she beyond youth health and good humour that could make him for her sake forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well as to what restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her i am not able to judge for i know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce but as to your other objection i a

the people who lived in it the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day they called at various times of the morning sometimes separately sometimes together and now and then accompanied by their aunt it was plain to them all that colonel fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society a persuasion which of course recommended him still more and elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him as well as by his evident admiration of

h a change in a man of so much pride excited not only astonishment but gratitudefor to love ardent love it must be attributed and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged as by no means unpleasing though it could not be exactly defined she respected she esteemed she was grateful to him she felt a real interest in his welfare and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should e
ng his former acquaintance had been numerous but since he had been in the militia it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them there was no one therefore who could be pointed out as likely to give any news of him and in the wretched state of his own finances there was a very powerful motive for secrecy in addition to his fear of discovery by lydias relations for it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him to a very considerable amount col
nt and had time to consider of it her reflections were in general satisfactory mr collins to be sure was neither sensible nor agreeable his society was irksome and his attachment to her must be imaginary but still he would be her husband without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony marriage had always been her object it was the only honourable provision for welleducated young women of small fortune and however uncertain of giving happiness must be their pleasantest preservative from
ntered the room and from all the others when they sat down to table she had only to say in reply that they had wandered about till she was beyond her own knowledge she coloured as she spoke but neither that nor anything else awakened a suspicion of the truth  the evening passed quietly unmarked by anything extraordinary the acknowledged lovers talked and laughed the unacknowledged were silent darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth and elizabeth agitated and confus
uence they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money great connections and pride  beyond a doubt they do wish him to choose miss darcy replied jane but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing they have known her much longer than they have known me no wonder if they love her better but whatever may be their own wishes it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brothers what sister would think herself at liberty to do it unless there w
eated by her perhaps that was the reason of his silence but it had not been so in derbyshire there he had talked to her friends when he could not to herself but now several minutes elapsed without bringing the sound of his voice and when occasionally unable to resist the impulse of curiosity she raised her eyes to his face she as often found him looking at jane as at herself and frequently on no object but the ground more thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please than when they last met were pl
 that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes  not at all he replied they were brightened by the exercise a short pause followed this speech and mrs hurst began again  i have an excessive regard for jane bennetshe is really a very sweet girland i wish with all my heart she were well settled but with such a father and mother and such low connections i am afraid there is no chance of it  i think i have heard you say that their uncle is 
 not now be sincere did you admire me for my impertinence  for the liveliness of your mind i did  you may as well call it impertinence at once it was very little less the fact is that you were sick of civility of deference of officious attention you were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking and thinking for your approbation alone i roused and interested you because i was so unlike them had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it bu

 my ever seeing him in hertfordshire you must know was at a balland at this ball what do you think he did he danced only four dances i am sorry to pain you but so it was he danced only four dances though gentlemen were scarce and to my certain knowledge more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner mr darcy you cannot deny the fact  i had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party  true and nobody can ever be introduced
bennet and therefore instead of making any answer she went on as before  i cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate if it was not for the entail i should not mind it  what should not you mind  i should not mind anything at all  let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility  i never can be thankful mr bennet for anything about the entail how anyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from ones own dau
nsible woman indeed added charlotte and a most attentive neighbour  very true my dear that is exactly what i say she is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference  the evening was spent chiefly in talking over hertfordshire news and telling again what had been already written and when it closed elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon charlottes degree of contentment to understand her address in guiding and composure in bearing with
ers  mr collins was punctual to his time and was received with great politeness by the whole family mr bennet indeed said little but the ladies were ready enough to talk and mr collins seemed neither in need of encouragement nor inclined to be silent himself he was a tall heavylooking young man of fiveandtwenty his air was grave and stately and his manners were very formal he had not been long seated before he complimented mrs bennet on having so fine a family of daughters said he had hea
hould be exposing herself again she longed to speak but could think of nothing to say and after a short silence mrs bennet began repeating her thanks to mr bingley for his kindness to jane with an apology for troubling him also with lizzy mr bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer and forced his younger sister to be civil also and say what the occasion required she performed her part indeed without much graciousness but mrs bennet was satisfied and soon afterwards ordered her carriage 
t we knew of him this could not have happened  perhaps it would have been better replied her sister  but to expose the former faults of any person without knowing what their present feelings were seemed unjustifiable  we acted with the best intentions  could colonel forster repeat the particulars of lydias note to his wife  he brought it with him for us to see  jane then took it from her pocketbook and gave it to elizabeth these were the contents        
en there are twenty i will visit them all  mr bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts sarcastic humour reserve and caprice that the experience of threeandtwenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character her mind was less difficult to develope she was a woman of mean understanding little information and uncertain temper when she was discontented she fancied herself nervous the business of her life was to get her daughters married its solace was visiting an
tance now  the astonishment of the ladies was just what he wishedthat of mrs bennet perhaps surpassing the rest though when the first tumult of joy was over she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while  how good it was in you my dear mr bennet but i knew i should persuade you at last i was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance well how pleased i am and it is such a good joke too that you should have gone this morning and never said 
d by marriage but he found in reply to this question      that wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making      his fortune by marriage in some other country under such      circumstances however he was not likely to be proof against the      temptation of immediate relief they met several times for there      was much to be discussed wickham of course wanted more than he      could get but at length was reduced to be reasonable everything      being settled between them mr
the kind of little things which please her ladyship and it is a sort of attention which i conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay  you judge very properly said mr bennet and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy may i ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment or are the result of previous study  they arise chiefly from what is passing at the time and though i sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arrangi
rivance breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from netherfield brought the following note for elizabeth        nind my dearest lizzie        i find myself very unwell this morning which i suppose is to be      imputed to my getting wet through yesterday my kind friends will      not hear of my returning home till i am better they insist also on      my seeing mr jonestherefore do not be alarmed if you should hear      of his having been to meand excepting a sore throat and a  
 but a short lease  whatever i do is done in a hurry replied he and therefore if i should resolve to quit netherfield i should probably be off in five minutes at present however i consider myself as quite fixed here  that is exactly what i should have supposed of you said elizabeth  you begin to comprehend me do you cried he turning towards her  oh yesi understand you perfectly  i wish i might take this for a compliment but to be so easily seen through 
 mrs bennet and her daughters then departed and elizabeth returned instantly to jane leaving her own and her relations behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and mr darcy the latter of whom however could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of her in spite of all miss bingleys witticisms on fine eyes  the day passed much as the day before had done mrs hurst and miss bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid who continued though slowly to mend and in t

 my uncle and aunt when he was in town and why not to me if he fears me why come hither if he no longer cares for me why silent teasing teasing man i will think no more about him  her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister who joined her with a cheerful look which showed her better satisfied with their visitors than elizabeth  now said she that this first meeting is over i feel perfectly easy i know my own strength and i shall never be e
al in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdomprovided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained you must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion which lead me to perform what i look on as a point of duty pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice which on every other subject shall be my constant guide though in the case before us i consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right 
n wearied by long expectations  the little gardiners attracted by the sight of a chaise were standing on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock and when the carriage drove up to the door the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces and displayed itself over their whole bodies in a variety of capers and frisks was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome  elizabeth jumped out and after giving each of them a hasty kiss hurried into the vestibule where jane who came running downs

looked impenetrably grave her daughters alarmed anxious uneasy  lydias voice was heard in the vestibule the door was thrown open and she ran into the room her mother stepped forwards embraced her and welcomed her with rapture gave her hand with an affectionate smile to wickham who followed his lady and wished them both joy with an alacrity which showed no doubt of their happiness  their reception from mr bennet to whom they then turned was not quite so cordial his countenance rather ga
y with this mr darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections his behaviour to myself has been scandalous but i verily believe i could forgive him anything and everything rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father  elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase and listened with all her heart but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry  mr wickham began to speak on more general topics meryton the neighbourhood the soc
re one among the sex who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman there is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings  she was a little revived however by his bringing back his coffeecup himself and she seized the opportunity of saying  is your sister at pemberley still  yes she will remain there till christmas  and quite alone have all her friends left her  mrs annesley is with her the others have been gone on to scarborough t

he rest there were notes to be written to all their friends at lambton with false excuses for their sudden departure an hour however saw the whole completed and mr gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn nothing remained to be done but to go and elizabeth after all the misery of the morning found herself in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed seated in the carriage and on the road to longbourn  i have been thinking it over again elizabeth said her un
leasing intelligence to send but even of that they would have been glad to be certain mr gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off  when he was gone they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on and their uncle promised at parting to prevail on mr bennet to return to longbourn as soon as he could to the great consolation of his sister who considered it as the only security for her husbands not being killed in a duel  mrs gardiner and the
 not yet learnt to condemn themwith respect to that other more weighty accusation of having injured mr wickham i can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family of what he has particularly accused me i am ignorant but of the truth of what i shall relate i can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity mr wickham is the son of a very respectable man who had for many years the management of all the pemberley estates and whose good conduct in the discha
at the same time so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered but the state of indecision in which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate and her fear if she once entered on the subject of being hurried into repeating something of bingley which might only grieve her sister further  it was the second week in may in which the three young ladies set out together from gracech
se he seemed to expect that whenever she came into kent again she would be staying there too his words seemed to imply it could he have colonel fitzwilliam in his thoughts she supposed if he meant anything he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter it distressed her a little and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the parsonage  she was engaged one day as she walked in reperusing janes last letter and dwelling on some passages which proved
 her place in the set amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to mr darcy and reading in her neighbours looks their equal amazement in beholding it they stood for some time without speaking a word and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances and at first was resolved not to break it till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk she made some slight observation on the
 wonder      however at her having any such fears now because if he had at all      cared about me we must have met long long ago he knows of my      being in town i am certain from something she said herself and      yet it would seem by her manner of talking as if she wanted to      persuade herself that he is really partial to miss darcy i cannot      understand it if i were not afraid of judging harshly i should be      almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of      dupli
y you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner you cannot refuse to dance i am sure when so much beauty is before you and taking her hand he would have given it to mr darcy who though extremely surprised was not unwilling to receive it when she instantly drew back and said with some discomposure to sir william  indeed sir i have not the least intention of dancing i entreat you not to suppose that i moved this way in order to beg for a partner

 things that it seems impossible to doubt lord gloucester was one of my greatest friends at oxford he showed me a letter that his wife had written to him when she was dying alone in her villa at mentone your name was implicated in the most terrible confession i ever read i told him that it was absurdthat i knew you thoroughly and that you were incapable of anything of the kind know you i wonder do i know you before i could answer that i should have to see your soul  to see my soul mutt

 defiance of divine justice as we do in almost all the sins we commit they think it no more a crime to kill a captive taken in war than we do to kill an ox or to eat human flesh than we do to eat mutton  when i considered this a little it followed necessarily that i was certainly in the wrong that these people were not murderers in the sense that i had before condemned them in my thoughts any more than those christians were murderers who often put to death the prisoners taken in battle or more f
is season i was much surprised with the increase of my family i had been concerned for the loss of one of my cats who ran away from me or as i thought had been dead and i heard no more tidings of her till to my astonishment she came home about the end of august with three kittens this was the more strange to me because though i had killed a wild cat as i called it with my gun yet i thought it was quite a different kind from our european cats but the young cats were the same kind of housebreed

n the world to come at them but i was not discouraged at this not doubting but i might now and then shoot one as it soon happened for after i had found their haunts a little i laid wait in this manner for them i observed if they saw me in the valleys though they were upon the rocks they would run away as in a terrible fright but if they were feeding in the valleys and i was upon the rocks they took no notice of me from whence i concluded that by the position of their optics their sight was so
he current was so strong the water was foul but perceiving the water clear i found the current abate and presently i found to the east at about half a mile a breach of the sea upon some rocks these rocks i found caused the current to part again and as the main stress of it ran away more southerly leaving the rocks to the northeast so the other returned by the repulse of the rocks and made a strong eddy which ran back again to the northwest with a very sharp stream  they who know what it is to

e had kept on board we had been all safethat is to say we had all got safe on shore and i had not been so miserable as to be left entirely destitute of all comfort and company as i now was this forced tears to my eyes again but as there was little relief in that i resolved if possible to get to the ship so i pulled off my clothesfor the weather was hot to extremityand took the water but when i came to the ship my difficulty was still greater to know how to get on board for as she lay agr
 together and set against one another so strong that for some time i could not part them again let the naturalists explain these things and the reason and manner of them all i can do is to describe the fact which was even surprising to me when i found it though i knew not from whence it proceeded it was doubtless the effect of ardent wishes and of strong ideas formed in my mind realising the comfort which the conversation of one of my fellowchristians would have been to me but it was not to be 
t i built me a little kind of a bower and surrounded it at a distance with a strong fence being a double hedge as high as i could reach well staked and filled between with brushwood and here i lay very secure sometimes two or three nights together always going over it with a ladder so that i fancied now i had my country house and my seacoast house and this work took me up to the beginning of august  i had but newly finished my fence and began to enjoy my labour when the rains came on and made 
smooth sea the sun shining upon it the sight was as i thought the most delightful that ever i saw  i had slept well in the night and was now no more seasick but very cheerful looking with wonder upon the sea that was so rough and terrible the day before and could be so calm and so pleasant in so little a time after and now lest my good resolutions should continue my companion who had enticed me away comes to me well bob says he clapping me upon the shoulder how do you do after i
cidents as my own partparticularly also as to their battles with the caribbeans who landed several times upon the island and as to the improvement they made upon the island itself and how five of them made an attempt upon the mainland and brought away eleven men and five women prisoners by which at my coming i found about twenty young children on the island  here i stayed about twenty days left them supplies of all necessary things and particularly of arms powder shot clothes tools and t

ted our souls to god in the most earnest manner and the wind driving us towards the shore we hastened our destruction with our own hands pulling as well as we could towards land  what the shore was whether rock or sand whether steep or shoal we knew not the only hope that could rationally give us the least shadow of expectation was if we might find some bay or gulf or the mouth of some river where by great chance we might have run our boat in or got under the lee of the land and perhaps made sm

 northward sloping towards the shore almost as far as winterton ness  we were not much more than a quarter of an hour out of our ship till we saw her sink and then i understood for the first time what was meant by a ship foundering in the sea i must acknowledge i had hardly eyes to look up when the seamen told me she was sinking for from the moment that they rather put me into the boat than that i might be said to go in my heart was as it were dead within me partly with fright partly with horror o
resently and then i spoke to the spaniard to let friday help him up if he could and lead him to the boat and then he should carry him to our dwelling where i would take care of him but friday a lusty strong fellow took the spaniard upon his back and carried him away to the boat and set him down softly upon the side or gunnel of the canoe with his feet in the inside of it and then lifting him quite in he set him close to his father and presently stepping out again launched the boat off and pa

ast could get into it or over it this cost me a great deal of time and labour especially to cut the piles in the woods bring them to the place and drive them into the earth  the entrance into this place i made to be not by a door but by a short ladder to go over the top which ladder when i was in i lifted over after me and so i was completely fenced in and fortified as i thought from all the world and consequently slept secure in the night which otherwise i could not have done though as it 
chet to cut down a quantity which i soon found for there was great plenty of them these i set up to dry within my circle or hedge and when they were fit for use i carried them to my cave and here during the next season i employed myself in making as well as i could a great many baskets both to carry earth or to carry or lay up anything as i had occasion and though i did not finish them very handsomely yet i made them sufficiently serviceable for my purpose thus afterwards i took care never t

ummaging my things i found a little bag which as i hinted before had been filled with corn for the feeding of poultrynot for this voyage but before as i suppose when the ship came from lisbon the little remainder of corn that had been in the bag was all devoured by the rats and i saw nothing in the bag but husks and dust and being willing to have the bag for some other use i think it was to put powder in when i divided it for fear of the lightning or some such use i shook the husks of corn 
 my rafts from the ship and hauling her up to the shore at highwater mark i made my man friday dig a little dock just big enough to hold her and just deep enough to give her water enough to float in and then when the tide was out we made a strong dam across the end of it to keep the water out and so she lay dry as to the tide from the sea and to keep the rain off we laid a great many boughs of trees so thick that she was as well thatched as a house and thus we waited for the months of november
in in about an hour more we came to the town where we were to lodge which we found in a terrible fright and all in arms for it seems the night before the wolves and some bears had broken into the village and put them in such terror that they were obliged to keep guard night and day but especially in the night to preserve their cattle and indeed their people  the next morning our guide was so ill and his limbs swelled so much with the rankling of his two wounds that he could go no farther so we 
sts and a third day in driving it into the ground for which purpose i got a heavy piece of wood at first but at last bethought myself of one of the iron crows which however though i found it made driving those posts or piles very laborious and tedious work   but what need i have been concerned at the tediousness of anything i had to do seeing i had time enough to do it in nor had i any other employment if that had been over at least that i could foresee except the ranging the island to seek for
the way i thought was a venture bold enough considering that i knew not how far it might go nor what was beyond it when i had got through the strait i found the roof rose higher up i believe near twenty feet but never was such a glorious sight seen in the island i daresay as it was to look round the sides and roof of this vault or cavethe wall reflected a hundred thousand lights to me from my two candles what it was in the rockwhether diamonds or any other precious stones or gold which i ra

t for us to expect her getting off we were in a dreadful condition indeed and had nothing to do but to think of saving our lives as well as we could we had a boat at our stern just before the storm but she was first staved by dashing against the ships rudder and in the next place she broke away and either sunk or was driven off to sea so there was no hope from her we had another boat on board but how to get her off into the sea was a doubtful thing however there was no time to debate for we f
f the ships course take an observation and in short to understand some things that were needful to be understood by a sailor for as he took delight to instruct me i took delight to learn and in a word this voyage made me both a sailor and a merchant for i brought home five pounds nine ounces of golddust for my adventure which yielded me in london at my return almost  and this filled me with those aspiring thoughts which have since so completed my ruin  yet even in this voyage i had 
to view the country and seek a proper place for my habitation and where to stow my goods to secure them from whatever might happen where i was i yet knew not whether on the continent or on an island whether inhabited or not inhabited whether in danger of wild beasts or not there was a hill not above a mile from me which rose up very steep and high and which seemed to overtop some other hills which lay as in a ridge from it northward i took out one of the fowlingpieces and one of the pistols a
 that every grain that they ate now was as it might be said a peckloaf to me in the consequence but coming up to the hedge i fired again and killed three of them this was what i wished for so i took them up and served them as we serve notorious thieves in englandhanged them in chains for a terror to others it is impossible to imagine that this should have such an effect as it had for the fowls would not only not come at the corn but in short they forsook all that part of the island and i 
his reason i removed that part of my business which required fire such as burning of pots and pipes c into my new apartment in the woods where after i had been some time i found to my unspeakable consolation a mere natural cave in the earth which went in a vast way and where i daresay no savage had he been at the mouth of it would be so hardy as to venture in nor indeed would any man else but one who like me wanted nothing so much as a safe retreat  the mouth of this hollow was at th
 but more especially in the latter part of my inhabiting this unhappy island besides many occasions which it is very likely i might have taken notice of if i had seen with the same eyes then that i see with now but it is never too late to be wise and i cannot but advise all considering men whose lives are attended with such extraordinary incidents as mine or even though not so extraordinary not to slight such secret intimations of providence let them come from what invisible intelligence they will
lease which were not so wild now as at first they might be supposed to be were well enough secured in it so without any further delay i removed ten young shegoats and two hegoats to this piece and when they were there i continued to perfect the fence till i had made it as secure as the other which however i did at more leisure and it took me up more time by a great deal all this labour i was at the expense of purely from my apprehensions on account of the print of a mans foot for as yet i 
ought about it but what consisted with the best principles both as a religious christian and as a grateful friend as appeared afterwards to my full satisfaction  while my jealousy of him lasted you may be sure i was every day pumping him to see if he would discover any of the new thoughts which i suspected were in him but i found everything he said was so honest and so innocent that i could find nothing to nourish my suspicion and in spite of all my uneasiness he made me at last entirely his own aga
 near my house as i could find them to my mind and fenced them in with a good hedge the stakes of which were all cut off that wood which i had set before and knew it would grow so that in a years time i knew i should have a quick or living hedge that would want but little repair this work did not take me up less than three months because a great part of that time was the wet season when i could not go abroad withindoors that is when it rained and i could not go out i found employment in the

as our seizing those seven men on shore would be no advantage to us if we let the boat escape because they would row away to the ship and then the rest of them would be sure to weigh and set sail and so our recovering the ship would be lost however we had no remedy but to wait and see what the issue of things might present the seven men came on shore and the three who remained in the boat put her off to a good distance from the shore and came to an anchor to wait for them so that it was impossible f

between the mean and the great that the wise man gave his testimony to this as the standard of felicity when he prayed to have neither poverty nor riches  he bade me observe it and i should always find that the calamities of life were shared among the upper and lower part of mankind but that the middle station had the fewest disasters and was not exposed to so many vicissitudes as the higher or lower part of mankind nay they were not subjected to so many distempers and uneasinesses either of body

s it was quite on the other part of the island was out of danger for certain it is that these savage people who sometimes haunted this island never came with any thoughts of finding anything here and consequently never wandered off from the coast and i doubt not but they might have been several times on shore after my apprehensions of them had made me cautious as well as before indeed i looked back with some horror upon the thoughts of what my condition would have been if i had chopped upon them a
 that which astonished him most was to know how i killed the other indian so far off so pointing to him he made signs to me to let him go to him and i bade him go as well as i could when he came to him he stood like one amazed looking at him turning him first on one side then on the other looked at the wound the bullet had made which it seems was just in his breast where it had made a hole and no great quantity of blood had followed but he had bled inwardly for he was quite dead he took up 
trees which i thought fit for our work and i set friday and his father to cut them down and then i caused the spaniard to whom i imparted my thoughts on that affair to oversee and direct their work i showed them with what indefatigable pains i had hewed a large tree into single planks and i caused them to do the like till they made about a dozen large planks of good oak near two feet broad thirtyfive feet long and from two inches to four inches thick what prodigious labour it took up any one m

as soon as they got to the place where their other boat lay they ran their boat into the beach and came all on shore hauling the boat up after them which i was glad to see for i was afraid they would rather have left the boat at an anchor some distance from the shore with some hands in her to guard her and so we should not be able to seize the boat being on shore the first thing they did they ran all to their other boat and it was easy to see they were under a great surprise to find her stripped

quently take fire and blow up all that was near it but as in the first place i should be unwilling to waste so much powder upon them my store being now within the quantity of one barrel so neither could i be sure of its going off at any certain time when it might surprise them and at best that it would do little more than just blow the fire about their ears and fright them but not sufficient to make them forsake the place so i laid it aside and then proposed that i would place myself in ambush 
 he was sure were led into this conspiracy by the rest being overpowered and frightened but that as for the boatswain who it seems was the chief officer among them and all the rest they were as outrageous as any of the ships crew and were no doubt made desperate in their new enterprise and terribly apprehensive he was that they would be too powerful for us i smiled at him and told him that men in our circumstances were past the operation of fear that seeing almost every condition that could b

the tide of ebb being made i plainly saw the current again as before only that it ran farther off being near half a league from the shore whereas in my case it set close upon the shore and hurried me and my canoe along with it which at another time it would not have done  this observation convinced me that i had nothing to do but to observe the ebbing and the flowing of the tide and i might very easily bring my boat about the island again but when i began to think of putting it in practice i had s

peak to him but she turned round once or twice as though to ask him if she was doing right  but you didnt see the gentlemans face  no sir he stood with his back to me all the time  can you describe him at all  he had on a light fawn overcoat and a traveling cap he was tall and slender like and the back of his head was dark  you didnt know him  oh no i dont think so sir  it was not your master mr carrington by any chance  mason look
a good deal of choice as to what her mistress shall wear now if after bristol anyone saw a lady in a bright blue coat and skirt and a fur toque he will be quite ready to swear he has seen mrs carrington  i began to reconstruct the maid would provide herself with duplicate clothes she and her accomplice chloroform and stab mrs carrington between london and bristol probably taking advantage of a tunnel her body is rolled under the seat the maid takes her place at weston she must make herself 
tea in the refreshmentroom but she was to wait at the station for her mistress who would return to bristol by an uptrain in the course of the afternoon the maid although very much astonished did as she was told she put the luggage in the cloakroom and had some tea but uptrain after uptrain came in and her mistress did not appear after the arrival of the last train she left the luggage where it was and went to a hotel near the station for the night this morning she read of the tragedy and r

alec simpson r n stepped from the platform at newton abbot into a firstclass compartment of the plymouth express a porter followed him with a heavy suitcase he was about to swing it up to the rack but the young sailor stopped him  noleave it on the seat ill put it up later here you are  thank you sir the porter generously tipped withdrew  doors banged a stentorian voice shouted plymouth only change for torquay plymouth next stop then a whistle blew and the trai
noticed how in all probability a newspaperboy will be selected she will insure his remembering her by giving him a large tip she also drew his attention to the color of her dress by a remark about one of the magazines after leaving weston she throws the knife out of the window to mark the place where the crime presumably occurred and changes her clothes or buttons a long mackintosh over them at taunton she leaves the train and returns to bristol as soon as possible where her accomplice has duly 
eturned to town by the first available train  is there nothing to account for your daughters sudden change of plan  well there is this according to jane mason at bristol flossie was no longer alone in her carriage there was a man in it who stood looking out of the farther window so that she could not see his face  the train was a corridor one of course  yes  which side was the corridor  on the platform side my daughter was standing in the corridor as she t

r father was quite taken up with the surprize of so sudden a journey and his fears that mr elton might never get safely to the end of it and saw nothing extraordinary in his language it was a very useful note for it supplied them with fresh matter for thought and conversation during the rest of their lonely evening mr woodhouse talked over his alarms and emma was in spirits to persuade them away with all her usual promptitude  she now resolved to keep harriet no longer in the dark she had reason t

mitchells i made up my mind on the subject i planned the match from that hour and when such success has blessed me in this instance dear papa you cannot think that i shall leave off matchmaking  i do not understand what you mean by success said mr knightley success supposes endeavour your time has been properly and delicately spent if you have been endeavouring for the last four years to bring about this marriage a worthy employment for a young ladys mind but if which

  just as it should be said mr john knightley and just as i hoped it was from your letters her wish of shewing you attention could not be doubted and his being a disengaged and social man makes it all easy i have been always telling you my love that i had no idea of the change being so very material to hartfield as you apprehended and now you have emmas account i hope you will be satisfied  why to be sure said mr woodhouseyes certainlyi cannot deny that mrs west

 quickness of mindhe saw the advantages of the match and rejoiced in them with all the constancy of his wife but the wonder of it was very soon nothing and by the end of an hour he was not far from believing that he had always foreseen it  it is to be a secret i conclude said he these matters are always a secret till it is found out that every body knows them only let me be told when i may speak outi wonder whether jane has any suspicion  he went to highbury the next morning a

he began to think it was to be and that he could not prevent ita very promising step of the mind on its way to resignation still however he was not happy nay he appeared so much otherwise that his daughters courage failed she could not bear to see him suffering to know him fancying himself neglected and though her understanding almost acquiesced in the assurance of both the mr knightleys that when once the event were over his distress would be soon over too she hesitatedshe could n

 bring our understandings a good deal nearer  yesa good deal nearer  but still not near enough to give me a chance of being right if we think differently  i have still the advantage of you by sixteen years experience and by not being a pretty young woman and a spoiled child come my dear emma let us be friends and say no more about it tell your aunt little emma that she ought to set you a better example than to be renewing old grievances and that if she were not wrong

 between them into the hall and looked at neither  there was no time for farther remark or explanation the dream must be borne with and mr knightley must take his seat with the rest round the large modern circular table which emma had introduced at hartfield and which none but emma could have had power to place there and persuade her father to use instead of the smallsized pembroke on which two of his daily meals had for forty years been crowded tea passed pleasantly and nobody seemed in a hurry

 early it will be breaking up the party  and no great harm if it does said mr woodhouse the sooner every party breaks up the better  but you do not consider how it may appear to the coles emmas going away directly after tea might be giving offence they are goodnatured people and think little of their own claims but still they must feel that any bodys hurrying away is no great compliment and miss woodhouses doing it would be more thought of than any other persons in

aintance in the street as he passedhe had not stopped he would not stop for more than a wordbut he had the vanity to think they would be disappointed if he did not call and much as he wished to stay longer at hartfield he must hurry off she had no doubt as to his being less in lovebut neither his agitated spirits nor his hurrying away seemed like a perfect cure and she was rather inclined to think it implied a dread of her returning power and a discreet resolution of not trusting himself
edge of the world  she had already satisfied herself that he thought harriet a beautiful girl which she trusted with such frequent meetings at hartfield was foundation enough on his side and on harriets there could be little doubt that the idea of being preferred by him would have all the usual weight and efficacy and he was really a very pleasing young man a young man whom any woman not fastidious might like he was reckoned very handsome his person much admired in general though not by her th

he had an unhappy state of health in general for the child of such a man for she hardly knew what indisposition was and if he did not invent illnesses for her she could make no figure in a message  the gipsies did not wait for the operations of justice they took themselves off in a hurry the young ladies of highbury might have walked again in safety before their panic began and the whole history dwindled soon into a matter of little importance but to emma and her nephewsin her imagination it main

you were preparing yourself to be an excellent wife all the time you were at hartfield you might not give emma such a complete education as your powers would seem to promise but you were receiving a very good education from her on the very material matrimonial point of submitting your own will and doing as you were bid and if weston had asked me to recommend him a wife i should certainly have named miss taylor  thank you there will be very little merit in making a good wife to such a man as

as her objection was nothing but her very great dislike of mrs elton of which mr weston must already be perfectly aware it was not worth bringing forward againit could not be done without a reproof to him which would be giving pain to his wife and she found herself therefore obliged to consent to an arrangement which she would have done a great deal to avoid an arrangement which would probably expose her even to the degradation of being said to be of mrs eltons party every feeling was offend

hey would or no she hardly wished to have more leisure for them there are people who the more you do for them the less they will do for themselves  mr and mrs john knightley from having been longer than usual absent from surry were exciting of course rather more than the usual interest till this year every long vacation since their marriage had been divided between hartfield and donwell abbey but all the holidays of this autumn had been given to seabathing for the children and it was therefore

is might soon be over  the affection of the whole family the warm attachment of miss campbell in particular was the more honourable to each party from the circumstance of janes decided superiority both in beauty and acquirements that nature had given it in feature could not be unseen by the young woman nor could her higher powers of mind be unfelt by the parents they continued together with unabated regard however till the marriage of miss campbell who by that chance that luck which so often def
ht it no hardship for either james or the horses had it taken place only once a year it would have been a grievance  mrs bates the widow of a former vicar of highbury was a very old lady almost past every thing but tea and quadrille she lived with her single daughter in a very small way and was considered with all the regard and respect which a harmless old lady under such untoward circumstances can excite her daughter enjoyed a most uncommon degree of popularity for a woman neither young hands

 out of her thoughts and say come maam do not let us think about it any more  her friends must all be sorry to lose her and will not colonel and mrs campbell be sorry to find that she has engaged herself before their return  yes jane says she is sure they will but yet this is such a situation as she cannot feel herself justified in declining i was so astonished when she first told me what she had been saying to mrs elton and when mrs elton at the same moment came congratulating 
on to every body and a mine of felicity to herself she was a great talker upon little matters which exactly suited mr woodhouse full of trivial communications and harmless gossip  mrs goddard was the mistress of a schoolnot of a seminary or an establishment or any thing which professed in long sentences of refined nonsense to combine liberal acquirements with elegant morality upon new principles and new systemsand where young ladies for enormous pay might be screwed out of health and into 
 to me you were saying something at the very moment of this burst of my amor patriae do not let me lose it i assure you the utmost stretch of public fame would not make me amends for the loss of any happiness in private life  i merely asked whether you had known much of miss fairfax and her party at weymouth  and now that i understand your question i must pronounce it to be a very unfair one it is always the ladys right to decide on the degree of acquaintance miss fairfax must al
 had a degree of gravity and sorrow tenderness towards the departed solicitude for the surviving friends and in a reasonable time curiosity to know where she would be buried goldsmith tells us that when lovely woman stoops to folly she has nothing to do but to die and when she stoops to be disagreeable it is equally to be recommended as a clearer of illfame mrs churchill after being disliked at least twentyfive years was now spoken of with compassionate allowances in one point she was fully

ome rich nor married miss bates stood in the very worst predicament in the world for having much of the public favour and she had no intellectual superiority to make atonement to herself or frighten those who might hate her into outward respect she had never boasted either beauty or cleverness her youth had passed without distinction and her middle of life was devoted to the care of a failing mother and the endeavour to make a small income go as far as possible and yet she was a happy woman and a

such is but one of the captains more inferior subalterns nevertheless as upon the good conduct of the harpooneers the success of a whaling voyage largely depends and since in the american fishery he is not only an important officer in the boat but under certain circumstances night watches on a whaling ground the command of the ships deck is also his therefore the grand political maxim of the sea demands that he should nominally live apart from the men before the mast and be in some way disti

hich the greenland whale is almost unworthy mentioning and here be it said that the greenland whale is an usurper upon the throne of the seas he is not even by any means the largest of the whales yet owing to the long priority of his claims and the profound ignorance which till some seventy years back invested the then fabulous or utterly unknown spermwhale and which ignorance to this present day still reigns in all but some few scientific retreats and whaleports this usurpation has been every w

 now the beheading of the sperm whale is a scientific anatomical feat upon which experienced whale surgeons very much pride themselves and not without reason  consider that the whale has nothing that can properly be called a neck on the contrary where his head and body seem to join there in that very place is the thickest part of him remember also that the surgeon must operate from above some eight or ten feet intervening between him and his subject and that subject almost hidden in a discolo

ests the entire body of the whale is not so much to be regarded as the skin of the creature as the skin of the skin so to speak for it were simply ridiculous to say that the proper skin of the tremendous whale is thinner and more tender than the skin of a newborn child but no more of this  assuming the blubber to be the skin of the whale then when this skin as in the case of a very large sperm whale will yield the bulk of one hundred barrels of oil and when it is considered that in quantity

so of a lighter materialpine it is furnished with a small rope called a warp of considerable length by which it can be hauled back to the hand after darting  but before going further it is important to mention here that though the harpoon may be pitchpoled in the same way with the lance yet it is seldom done and when done is still less frequently successful on account of the greater weight and inferior length of the harpoon as compared with the lance which in effect become serious drawbacks a

 extending the spermaceti whale fisheries in this book is an outline purporting to be a picture of a physeter or spermaceti whale drawn by scale from one killed on the coast of mexico august  and hoisted on deck i doubt not the captain had this veracious picture taken for the benefit of his marines to mention but one thing about it let me say that it has an eye which applied according to the accompanying scale to a full grown sperm whale would make the eye of that whale a bowwindow 
an or malay could have smote him with more seeming malice small reason was there to doubt then that ever since that almost fatal encounter ahab had cherished a wild vindictiveness against the whale all the more fell for that in his frantic morbidness he at last came to identify with him not only all his bodily woes but all his intellectual and spiritual exasperations the white whale swam before him as the monomaniac incarnation of all those malicious agencies which some deep men feel eating in them

telling me about the different ships that we passed by their rig tonnage and nationality explaining the work that was going forwardhow one was discharging another taking in cargo and a third making ready for seaand every now and then telling me some little anecdote of ships or seamen or repeating a nautical phrase till i had learned it perfectly i began to see that here was one of the best of possible shipmates  when we got to the inn the squire and dr livesey were seated together finishing a

nd great tracts of sand lay uncovered the air after the heat of the day chilled me through my jacket  the hispaniola still lay where she had anchored but sure enough there was the jolly rogerthe black flag of piracyflying from her peak even as i looked there came another red flash and another report that sent the echoes clattering and one more roundshot whistled through the air it was the last of the cannonade  i lay for some time watching the bustle which succeeded the attack men were dem
 from the murderers and as i ran fear grew and grew upon me until it turned into a kind of frenzy  indeed could anyone be more entirely lost than i when the gun fired how should i dare to go down to the boats among those fiends still smoking from their crime would not the first of them who saw me wring my neck like a snipes would not my absence itself be an evidence to them of my alarm and therefore of my fatal knowledge it was all over i thought goodbye to the hispaniola goodbye to the s
inging it was only a snatch that reached our ears followed by the former silence  heaven forgive them said the doctor tis the mutineers  all drunk sir struck in the voice of silver from behind us  silver i should say was allowed his entire liberty and in spite of daily rebuffs seemed to regard himself once more as quite a privileged and friendly dependent indeed it was remarkable how well he bore these slights and with what unwearying politeness he kept on trying to ingra
ast thundering and thundering by day and night and i scarce believe there is one spot in the island where a man would be out of earshot of their noise  i walked along beside the surf with great enjoyment till thinking i was now got far enough to the south i took the cover of some thick bushes and crept warily up to the ridge of the spit  behind me was the sea in front the anchorage the sea breeze as though it had the sooner blown itself out by its unusual violence was already at an end it had be
is i get a rough answer do i not well if i speak back pikes will be going in two shakes if i dont silver will see theres something under that and the games up now weve only one man to rely on  and who is that asked the squire  silver sir returned the captain hes as anxious as you and i to smother things up this is a tiff hed soon talk em out of it if he had the chance and what i propose to do is to give him the chance lets allow the men an aftern
nchorage to the east and is joined at halfwater to skeleton island and now as i rose to my feet i saw some distance further down the spit and rising from among low bushes an isolated rock pretty high and peculiarly white in colour it occurred to me that this might be the white rock of which ben gunn had spoken and that some day or other a boat might be wanted and i should know where to look for one  then i skirted among the woods until i had regained the rear or shoreward side of the stockade 
my friend he said to the fellow with the bandaged head and if ever any person had a close shave it was you your head must be as hard as iron well george how goes it youre a pretty colour certainly why your liver man is upside down did you take that medicine did he take that medicine men  aye aye sir he took it sure enough returned morgan  because you see since i am mutineers doctor or prison doctor as i prefer to call it says doctor livesey in his pleasa
 the mast knows more than i do i dont call that fair now do you  no said dr livesey i dont  next said the captain i learn we are going after treasurehear it from my own hands mind you now treasure is ticklish work i dont like treasure voyages on any account and i dont like them above all when they are secret and when begging your pardon mr trelawney the secret has been told to the parrot  silvers parrot asked the squire  its a w
 upstairs in the front room and the thought had been mingled in my nightmares with that of the onelegged seafaring man but by this time we had all long ceased to pay any particular notice to the song it was new that night to nobody but dr livesey and on him i observed it did not produce an agreeable effect for he looked up for a moment quite angrily before he went on with his talk to old taylor the gardener on a new cure for the rheumatics in the meantime the captain gradually brightened up at 
cried who goes  i turned to run struck violently against one person recoiled and ran full into the arms of a second who for his part closed upon and held me tight  bring a torch dick said silver when my capture was thus assured  and one of the men left the loghouse and presently returned with a lighted brand  the red glare of the torch lighting up the interior of the block house showed me the worst of my apprehensions realized the pirates were in possession of the house and stores
nd by shore to cut us off  theyll have a hot run sir returned the captain jack ashore you know its not them i mind its the roundshot carpet bowls my ladys maid couldnt miss tell us squire when you see the match and well hold water  in the meanwhile we had been making headway at a good pace for a boat so overloaded and we had shipped but little water in the process we were now close in thirty or forty strokes and we should beach her for the ebb had already 
ece of undulating sandy country about a mile long dotted with a few pines and a great number of contorted trees not unlike the oak in growth but pale in the foliage like willows on the far side of the open stood one of the hills with two quaint craggy peaks shining vividly in the sun  i now felt for the first time the joy of exploration the isle was uninhabited my shipmates i had left behind and nothing lived in front of me but dumb brutes and fowls i turned hither and thither among the trees
as strong as iron it was a happy relief for us when the door opened and doctor livesey came in on his visit to my father  oh doctor we cried what shall we do where is he wounded  wounded a fiddlesticks end said the doctor no more wounded than you or i the man has had a stroke as i warned him now mrs hawkins just you run upstairs to your husband and tell him if possible nothing about it for my part i must do my best to save this fellows trebly worthless life 
t was to die  the squire dropped down beside him on his knees and kissed his hand crying like a child  be i going doctor he asked  tom my man said i youre going home  i wish i had had a lick at them with the gun first he replied  tom said the squire say you forgive me wont you  would that be respectful like from me to you squire was the answer howsoever so be it amen  after a little while of silence he said he thought somebody mig

to see you  and he took my hand in his large firm grasp  just then one of the customers at the far side rose suddenly and made for the door it was close by him and he was out in the street in a moment but his hurry had attracted my notice and i recognized him at glance it was the tallowfaced man wanting two fingers who had come first to the admiral benbow  oh i cried stop him its black dog  i dont care two coppers who he is cried silver but he hasnt paid his
atching his head and making a large allowance sir for all the gifts of providence i should say we were pretty close hauled  how do you mean i asked  its a pity sir we lost that second load thats what i mean  replied the captain as for powder and shot well do but the rations are short very shortso short dr livesey that were perhaps as well without that extra mouth  and he pointed to the dead body under the flag  just then with a roar and a whistle a
nd miscreant threatened him in horrid terms and tried in vain to catch the stick and wrest it from his grasp  this quarrel was the saving of us for while it was still raging another sound came from the top of the hill on the side of the hamletthe tramp of horses galloping almost at the same time a pistolshot flash and report came from the hedge side and that was plainly the last signal of danger for the buccaneers turned at once and ran separating in every direction one seaward along the cove
ng and she lies in north inlet on the southern beach and just below high water at half tide she must be high and dry  the ship exclaimed the doctor  rapidly i described to him my adventures and he heard me out in silence  there is a kind of fate in this he observed when i had done every step its you that saves our lives and do you suppose by any chance that we are going to let you lose yours that would be a poor return my boy you found out the plot you found ben gunnt
heyve tramped i dont know wheres they are  he drew again quietly at his pipe  and lest you should take it into that head of yours he went on that you was included in the treaty heres the last word that was said how many are you says i to leave four says he four and one of us wounded as for that boy i dont know where he is confound him says he nor i dont much care were about sick of him these was his words  is that all
ng loudly like the old buccaneer at home in his apoplectic fit but the bones of his chest had been crushed by the blow and his skull fractured in falling and some time in the following night without sign or sound he went to his maker  as for the captain his wounds were grievous indeed but not dangerous no organ was fatally injured andersons ballfor it was job that shot him firsthad broken his shoulderblade and touched the lung not badly the second had only torn and displaced some muscles 
  first point began mr smollett we must go on because we cant turn back if i gave the word to go about they would rise at once second point we have time before usat least until this treasures found third point there are faithful hands now sir its got to come to blows sooner or later and what i propose is to take time by the forelock as the saying is and come to blows some fine day when they least expect it we can count i take it on your own home servants mr trelawne
 i asked  well its all that youre to hear my son returned silver  and now i am to choose  and now you are to choose and you may lay to that said silver  well said i i am not such a fool but i know pretty well what i have to look for let the worst come to the worst its little i care ive seen too many die since i fell in with you but theres a thing or two i have to tell you i said and by this time i was quite excited and the first is this here
himself with a hand against the wall now i give you warning george he cried one more word of your sauce and ill call you down and fight you how why how do i know you had ought to tell me thatyou and the rest that lost me my schooner with your interference burn you but not you you cant you haint got the invention of a cockroach but civil you can speak and shall george merry you may lay to that  thats fair enow said the old man morgan  fair i reckon so
hanging of the powder jack answers one  why by the powers cried long john if we do well miss the morning tide  my orders said the captain shortly you may go below my man hands will want supper  aye aye sir answered the cook and touching his forelock he disappeared at once in the direction of his galley  thats a good man captain said the doctor  very likely sir replied captain smollett easy with that meneasy he ran on to t
e current must slacken and then we can dodge back along the shore  the currents less aready sir said the man gray who was sitting in the foresheets you can ease her off a bit  thank you my man said i quite as if nothing had happened for we had all quietly made up our minds to treat him like one of ourselves  suddenly the captain spoke up again and i thought his voice was a little changed  the gun said he  i have thought of that said i for i made sure
ise did i well now you all know what i wanted and you all know if that had been done that wed a been aboard the hispaniola this night as ever was every man of us alive and fit and full of good plumduff and the treasure in the hold of her by thunder well who crossed me who forced my hand as was the lawful capn who tipped me the black spot the day we landed and began this dance ah its a fine danceim with you thereand looks mighty like a hornpipe in a ropes end at executi
ughs which showed me the sea breeze had set in higher than usual soon cool draughts of air began to reach me and a few steps farther i came forth into the open borders of the grove and saw the sea lying blue and sunny to the horizon and the surf tumbling and tossing its foam along the beach  i have never seen the sea quiet round treasure island the sun might blaze overhead the air be without a breath the surface smooth and blue but still these great rollers would be running along all the external co
mmocks and even the mate seemed pleased with the arrangement even he perhaps had been doubtful as to the crew but that is only guess for as you shall hear we had not long the benefit of his opinion  we were all hard at work changing the powder and the berths when the last man or two and long john along with them came off in a shoreboat  the cook came up the side like a monkey for cleverness and as soon as he saw what was doing so ho mates says he whats this  were ac
was a very safe boat for a person of my height and weight both buoyant and clever in a seaway but she was the most crossgrained lopsided craft to manage do as you pleased she always made more leeway than anything else and turning round and round was the manoeuvre she was best at even ben gunn himself has admitted that she was queer to handle till you knew her way  certainly i did not know her way she turned in every direction but the one i was bound to go the most part of the time we were
  and so jim said the doctor you have the thing that they were after have you  here it is sir said i and gave him the oilskin packet  the doctor looked it all over as if his fingers were itching to open it but instead of doing that he put it quietly in the pocket of his coat  squire said he when dance has had his ale he must of course be off on his majestys service but i mean to keep jim hawkins here to sleep at my house and with your permission i propose
r which only proved the qualities of the hispaniola every man on board seemed well content and they must have been hard to please if they had been otherwise for it is my belief there was never a ships company so spoiled since noah put to sea double grog was going on the least excuse there was duff on odd days as for instance if the squire heard it was any mans birthday and always a barrel of apples standing broached in the waist for anyone to help himself that had a fancy  never knew goo
re injured much or little none could ever tell like enough to judge from the sound his back was broken on the spot but he had no time given him to recover silver agile as a monkey even without leg or crutch was on the top of him next moment and had twice buried his knife up to the hilt in that defenceless body from my place of ambush i could hear him pant aloud as he struck the blows  i do not know what it rightly is to faint but i do know that for the next little while the whole world swam away
e across a light cord that was trailing overboard across the stern bulwarks instantly i grasped it  why i should have done so i can hardly say it was at first mere instinct but once i had it in my hands and found it fast curiosity began to get the upper hand and i determined i should have one look through the cabin window  i pulled in hand over hand on the cord and when i judged myself near enough rose at infinite risk to about half my height and thus commanded the roof and a slice of the interior 
er contemptuously leastways if you dont i do and i wait hereand im still your capn mindtill you outs with your grievances and i reply in the meantime your black spot aint worth a biscuit after that well see  oh replied george you dont be under no kind of apprehension were all square we are first youve made a hash of this cruiseyoull be a bold man to say no to that second you let the enemy out o this here trap for nothing why did they want
bmit if we can come to terms and no bones about it all i ask is your word capn smollett to let me safe and sound out of this here stockade and one minute to get out o shot before a gun is fired  my man said captain smollett i have not the slightest desire to talk to you if you wish to talk to me you can come thats all if theres any treachery itll be on your side and the lord help you  thats enough capn shouted long john cheerily a word from you
 each evidently supplied with several muskets kept up a hot though useless fire on the loghouse  the four who had boarded made straight before them for the building shouting as they ran and the men among the trees shouted back to encourage them several shots were fired but such was the hurry of the marksmen that not one appears to have taken effect in a moment the four pirates had swarmed up the mound and were upon us  the head of job anderson the boatswain appeared at the middle loophole  
 if you was my mother he cried  well thats my first concession added the doctor my second is a piece of advice keep the boy close beside you and when you need help halloo im off to seek it for you and that itself will show you if i speak at random goodbye jim  and dr livesey shook hands with me through the stockade nodded to silver and set off at a brisk pace into the wood  jim said silver when we were alone if i saved your life you saved mine and ill n
his nose like a foghorn and we and the people who came about our house soon learned to let him be every day when he came back from his stroll he would ask if any seafaring men had gone by along the road at first we thought it was the want of company of his own kind that made him ask this question but at last we began to see he was desirous to avoid them when a seaman did put up at the admiral benbow as now and then some did making by the coast road for bristol he would look in at him through the cu
this here affair for mind you its serious young hawkins and neither you nor mes come out of it with what i should make so bold as to call credit nor you neither says you not smartnone of the pair of us smart but dash my buttons that was a good un about my score  and he began to laugh again and that so heartily that though i did not see the joke as he did i was again obliged to join him in his mirth  on our little walk along the quays he made himself the most interesting companion 
nshot a great way off and supposed them to be hunting a council was held and it was decided that we must desert them on the islandto the huge glee i must say of ben gunn and with the strong approval of gray we left a good stock of powder and shot the bulk of the salt goat a few medicines and some other necessaries tools clothing a spare sail a fathom or two of rope and by the particular desire of the doctor a handsome present of tobacco  that was about our last doing on the island before 
why no says i hes about the last of this crew for that i take it  well shipmate said gray mad he may not be but if hes not you mark my words i am  i take it replied i the doctor has his idea and if i am right hes going now to see ben gunn  i was right as appeared later but in the meantime the house being stifling hot and the little patch of sand inside the palisade ablaze with midday sun i began to get another thought into my head which was not
 very rogue that i had seen some hours before stridelegs upon the palisade apparently they were talking and laughing though at that distanceupwards of a milei could of course hear no word of what was said all at once there began the most horrid unearthly screaming which at first startled me badly though i had soon remembered the voice of captain flint and even thought i could make out the bird by her bright plumage as she sat perched upon her masters wrist  soon after the jollyboat shoved
 never ceasing to expect death at the next plunge gradually weariness grew upon me a numbness an occasional stupor fell upon my mind even in the midst of my terrors until sleep at last supervened and in my seatossed coracle i lay and dreamed of home and the old admiral benbow  it was broad day when i awoke and found myself tossing at the southwest end of treasure island the sun was up but was still hid from me behind the great bulk of the spyglass which on this side descended almost to the sea in

 i broke immediately doctor let me speak get the captain and squire down to the cabin and then make some pretence to send for me i have terrible news  the doctor changed countenance a little but next moment he was master of himself  thank you jim said he quite loudly that was all i wanted to know  as if he had asked me a question  and with that he turned on his heel and rejoined the other two they spoke together for a little and though none of them started or raised his vo

ke to try it what would you do robert when the indians came to the island  i would do just as robinson crusoe did i would shoot as many of them as i could i would catch one of them and make him be my man friday  suppose they should happen to shoot you instead and then broil you for their supper dont you think you would make a dainty dish to set before the king  i am certain that i could get along just as well as robinson crusoe did  perhaps not every one dont
very thing was spoiled by the unfeeling conduct on the part of trip there was not even enough for his supper left though his hunger made him partake of some of the cleanest of the mess  the sun set and the darkness gathered around him he now crawled into his new house and rolled himself up in his blanket but it was very gloomy and he was cold and tired how different from his fathers kitchen  robert began to think what a fool he was and wished himself at home with all his heart he wondered wha
o eat and how he obtained it how he built a boat and could not get it into the water and then built another and did get it into the water about his dog and goats his cat and his parrots and his man friday  the poor man lived alone for a long time and most of us would think he could not have been very happy away from his country and friends with no one to speak to but his cat and goats and his man friday and none of them could understand him  robert gray didnt think so he read the book thr
t his sister thought had become of him of course she had missed him before this time and very likely she was then searching for him in the village perhaps the people would make just such a fuss as they did when frank lee was lost  he had not thought of this before and he felt sorry that he had caused his sister so much pain and anxiety as his absence would occasion  as he shivered with cold he came to the conclusion that it was not so pleasant after all to be a robinson crusoe the book was all ver
provisions he had obtained for use on the island she had scratched open the papers and the gingerbread was broken into a hundred pieces the cheese was all mashed up and ground in with the gingerbread and the whole mass was well mixed with black hairs from the cats back  robert was so angry when he saw the wreck within the box that he was tempted to throw pussy overboard for the mischief she had done but the thought that it was not the cats fault saved her from a cold bath  it was not of her ow
 for he did not mean to go to sea as he called it to himself in such a shabby craft as that in which joe had been wrecked he had tools from the shop a hammer and plenty of nails and he made the raft very strong and safe  it was raised above the water so that the top was dry when he stood upon it and to make it more secure he put a little fence all round it to prevent him from slipping off if the craft should strike upon a rock  then he made two oars with which he could move and steer the raft h
 by swimming ashore on the other hand  when she found there was no way to get ashore without taking to the water she took her stand next to trip and began to mew in a most sorrowful manner the dog looked at her and bowwowed two or three times as much as to say what are you afraid of pussy dont you see im not scared  robert went to work upon the contents of the box to save some of his food if he could the hatchet and the nails were covered with soft cheese and it took him some tim
inson crusoe all alone on an island by yourself asked robert very gravely  well i dont know as i should like it overmuch i should want some of jennys doughnuts and apple pies  pooh who cares for them said robert with a sneer  i do for one  well i dont i would just as lief have oysters and cocoanuts fish and grapes and such things  without any butter or sugar or molasses  i could get along without them  then there would be great storms
ecover the former  the raft floated out about a rod from the shore and began to go down stream the water was quite shallow and robert waded in till he got hold of the truant craft but in attempting to jump upon the platform he slipped and went all over into the water  his courage was good however and he managed to pick himself up and climb upon the raft the ducking did him no harm but the day was cool and his wet clothes did not add to his comfort  pulling to the shore again he fastened the 
the hardships of crusoe life crackers and cheese were not very dainty fare to a boy who had been used to living upon beefsteak and hot biscuit and river water was not at all like tea and coffee or even the water of his fathers well  in spite of these difficulties robert went to work like a hero and by sunset he had finished his house so far as he could for his stock of boards fell short when he had covered the top and one side of the dwelling  while he was so busy he had not kept watch of trip

 upon his heart there was no movement he was dead  the blood had been streaming from my nose but i had taken no notice of it i dont know what it was that put it into my head to write upon the wall with it perhaps it was some mischievous idea of setting the police upon a wrong track for i felt lighthearted and cheerful i remembered a german being found in new york with rache written up above him and it was argued at the time in the newspapers that the secret societies must have done it i gue
heart of the desert  the name of nauvoo evidently recalled recollections to john ferrier i see he said you are the mormons  we are the mormons answered his companions with one voice  and where are you going  we do not know the hand of god is leading us under the person of our prophet you must come before him he shall say what is to be done with you  they had reached the base of the hill by this time and were surrounded by crowds of the pilgrimspalefaced meek
ab this amateur bloodhound carolled away like a lark while i meditated upon the manysidedness of the human mind  our mornings exertions had been too much for my weak health and i was tired out in the afternoon after holmes departure for the concert i lay down upon the sofa and endeavoured to get a couple of hours sleep it was a useless attempt my mind had been too much excited by all that had occurred and the strangest fancies and surmises crowded into it every time that i closed my eyes

inconsequent remark he strode on into the house followed by gregson whose features expressed his astonishment  a short passage bare planked and dusty led to the kitchen and offices two doors opened out of it to the left and to the right one of these had obviously been closed for many weeks the other belonged to the diningroom which was the apartment in which the mysterious affair had occurred holmes walked in and i followed him with that subdued feeling at my heart which the presence of death in
death under the hoofs of the unwieldy and terrified animals unaccustomed to sudden emergencies her head began to swim and her grip upon the bridle to relax choked by the rising cloud of dust and by the steam from the struggling creatures she might have abandoned her efforts in despair but for a kindly voice at her elbow which assured her of assistance at the same moment a sinewy brown hand caught the frightened horse by the curb and forcing a way through the drove soon brought her to the outskirts
 whats the matter youre not looking quite yourself this brixton road affair has upset you  to tell the truth it has i said i ought to be more casehardened after my afghan experiences i saw my own comrades hacked to pieces at maiwand without losing my nerve  i can understand there is a mystery about this which stimulates the imagination where there is no imagination there is no horror have you seen the evening paper  no  it gives a fairly good account of 
ver held up her head again but pined away and died within a month her sottish husband who had married her principally for the sake of john ferriers property did not affect any great grief at his bereavement but his other wives mourned over her and sat up with her the night before the burial as is the mormon custom they were grouped round the bier in the early hours of the morning when to their inexpressible fear and astonishment the door was flung open and a savagelooking weatherbeaten man
r sir he remarked it beats anything i have seen and i am no chicken  there is no clue said gregson  none at all chimed in lestrade  sherlock holmes approached the body and kneeling down examined it intently you are sure that there is no wound he asked pointing to numerous gouts and splashes of blood which lay all round  positive cried both detectives  then of course this blood belongs to a second individualpresumably the murderer if murder has been

 upon a rock and took a long and steady aim before drawing the trigger the animal sprang into the air tottered for a moment upon the edge of the precipice and then came crashing down into the valley beneath  the creature was too unwieldy to lift so the hunter contented himself with cutting away one haunch and part of the flank with this trophy over his shoulder he hastened to retrace his steps for the evening was already drawing in he had hardly started however before he realized the difficulty 
ved at last at last when he saw five give way to four and that again to three he lost heart and abandoned all hope of escape singlehanded and with his limited knowledge of the mountains which surrounded the settlement he knew that he was powerless the morefrequented roads were strictly watched and guarded and none could pass along them without an order from the council turn which way he would there appeared to be no avoiding the blow which hung over him yet the old man never wavered in his res
dingly in three years he was better off than his neighbours in six he was welltodo in nine he was rich and in twelve there were not half a dozen men in the whole of salt lake city who could compare with him from the great inland sea to the distant wahsatch mountains there was no name better known than that of john ferrier  there was one way and only one in which he offended the susceptibilities of his coreligionists no argument or persuasion could ever induce him to set up a female establishment a
eels together raised his hand in a salute and was gone  i confess that i was considerably startled by this fresh proof of the practical nature of my companions theories my respect for his powers of analysis increased wondrously there still remained some lurking suspicion in my mind however that the whole thing was a prearranged episode intended to dazzle me though what earthly object he could have in taking me in was past my comprehension when i looked at him he had finished reading the note

hat he was ill at ease  he expected that he would receive some message or remonstrance from young as to his conduct and he was not mistaken though it came in an unlookedfor manner upon rising next morning he found to his surprise a small square of paper pinned on to the coverlet of his bed just over his chest on it was printed in bold straggling letters  twentynine days are given you for amendment and then  the dash was more fearinspiring than any threat could have been how this
 that one would hardly have guessed the minuteness with which it was conducted finally he sniffed the dead mans lips and then glanced at the soles of his patent leather boots  he has not been moved at all he asked  no more than was necessary for the purposes of our examination  you can take him to the mortuary now he said there is nothing more to be learned  gregson had a stretcher and four men at hand at his call they entered the room and the stranger was lifted and c
ut jefferson will soon be here  yes it will not be long before he comes the sooner the better for we do not know what their next move may be  it was indeed high time that someone capable of giving advice and help should come to the aid of the sturdy old farmer and his adopted daughter in the whole history of the settlement there had never been such a case of rank disobedience to the authority of the elders if minor errors were punished so sternly what would be the fate of this arch rebel

pt all the way a pace or two ahead now pulled up in the middle of the pavement and in spite of the biting weather took off his hat and mopped his brow with a red pockethandkerchief but for all the hurry of his coming these were not the dews of exertion that he wiped away but the moisture of some strangling anguish for his face was white and his voice when he spoke harsh and broken  well sir he said here we are and god grant there be nothing wrong  amen poole said the lawy
 problem of my conduct was solved hyde was thenceforth impossible whether i would or not i was now confined to the better part of my existence and o how i rejoiced to think of it with what willing humility i embraced anew the restrictions of natural life with what sincere renunciation i locked the door by which i had so often gone and come and ground the key under my heel  the next day came the news that the murder had not been overlooked that the guilt of hyde was patent to the world and that t
 he said at last getting to his feet  well but since we have touched upon this business and for the last time i hope continued the doctor there is one point i should like you to understand i have really a very great interest in poor hyde i know you have seen him he told me so and i fear he was rude but i do sincerely take a great a very great interest in that young man and if i am taken away utterson i wish you to promise me that you will bear with him and get his rights for him i 
en that we should be frank said the other we both think more than we have said let us make a clean breast this masked figure that you saw did you recognise it  well sir it went so quick and the creature was so doubled up that i could hardly swear to that was the answer but if you mean was it mr hydewhy yes i think it was you see it was much of the same bigness and it had the same quick light way with it and then who else could have got in by the laboratory door yo
he body of a selfdestroyer  we have come too late he said sternly whether to save or punish hyde is gone to his account and it only remains for us to find the body of your master  the far greater proportion of the building was occupied by the theatre which filled almost the whole ground storey and was lighted from above and by the cabinet which formed an upper storey at one end and looked upon the court a corridor joined the theatre to the door on the bystreet and with this the cabi
else he asked  poole nodded once he said once i heard it weeping  weeping how that said the lawyer conscious of a sudden chill of horror  weeping like a woman or a lost soul said the butler i came away with that upon my heart that i could have wept too  but now the ten minutes drew to an end poole disinterred the axe from under a stack of packing straw the candle was set upon the nearest table to light them to the attack and they drew near with bated breath 
s  this last however was not so easy of accomplishment for mr hyde had numbered few familiarseven the master of the servant maid had only seen him twice his family could nowhere be traced he had never been photographed and the few who could describe him differed widely as common observers will only on one point were they agreed and that was the haunting sense of unexpressed deformity with which the fugitive impressed his beholders  it was late in the afternoon when mr utterson found his 
wellpolished brasses and general cleanliness and gaiety of note instantly caught and pleased the eye of the passenger  two doors from one corner on the left hand going east the line was broken by the entry of a court and just at that point a certain sinister block of building thrust forward its gable on the street it was two storeys high showed no window nothing but a door on the lower storey and a blind forehead of discoloured wall on the upper and bore in every feature the marks of prolonged an
none could come near to me at first without a visible misgiving of the flesh this as i take it was because all human beings as we meet them are commingled out of good and evil and edward hyde alone in the ranks of mankind was pure evil  i lingered but a moment at the mirror the second and conclusive experiment had yet to be attempted it yet remained to be seen if i had lost my identity beyond redemption and must flee before daylight from a house that was no longer mine and hurrying back to my ca
 case was what struck me he was the usual cut and dry apothecary of no particular age and colour with a strong edinburgh accent and about as emotional as a bagpipe well sir he was like the rest of us every time he looked at my prisoner i saw that sawbones turn sick and white with the desire to kill him i knew what was in his mind just as he knew what was in mine and killing being out of the question we did the next best we told the man we could and would make such a scandal out of this as shoul
uiously took my orders led me to a private room and brought me wherewithal to write hyde in danger of his life was a creature new to me shaken with inordinate anger strung to the pitch of murder lusting to inflict pain yet the creature was astute mastered his fury with a great effort of the will composed his two important letters one to lanyon and one to poole and that he might receive actual evidence of their being posted sent them out with directions that they should be registered thenceforwa
ad like quills sir if that was my master why had he a mask upon his face if it was my master why did he cry out like a rat and run from me i have served him long enough and then the man paused and passed his hand over his face  these are all very strange circumstances said mr utterson but i think i begin to see daylight your master poole is plainly seized with one of those maladies that both torture and deform the sufferer hence for aught i know the alteration of his voice 
 screams or else he would see a room in a rich house where his friend lay asleep dreaming and smiling at his dreams and then the door of that room would be opened the curtains of the bed plucked apart the sleeper recalled and lo there would stand by his side a figure to whom power was given and even at that dead hour he must rise and do its bidding the figure in these two phases haunted the lawyer all night and if at any time he dozed over it was but to see it glide more stealthily through slee
 of my old friend perhaps affected me somewhat i do not know it was at least but a drop in the sea to the abhorrence with which i looked back upon these hours a change had come over me it was no longer the fear of the gallows it was the horror of being hyde that racked me i received lanyons condemnation partly in a dream it was partly in a dream that i came home to my own house and got into bed i slept after the prostration of the day with a stringent and profound slumber which not even the nigh
the note of her lamentation they had all started and turned towards the inner door with faces of dreadful expectation and now continued the butler addressing the knifeboy reach me a candle and well get this through hands at once and then he begged mr utterson to follow him and led the way to the back garden  now sir said he you come as gently as you can i want you to hear and i dont want you to be heard and see here sir if by any chance he was to ask you in don
inking of the pulse at the time i set it down to some idiosyncratic personal distaste and merely wondered at the acuteness of the symptoms but i have since had reason to believe the cause to lie much deeper in the nature of man and to turn on some nobler hinge than the principle of hatred  this person who had thus from the first moment of his entrance struck in me what i can only describe as a disgustful curiosity was dressed in a fashion that would have made an ordinary person laughable his clo
es while their own person and reputation sat under shelter i was the first that ever did so for his pleasures i was the first that could plod in the public eye with a load of genial respectability and in a moment like a schoolboy strip off these lendings and spring headlong into the sea of liberty but for me in my impenetrable mantle the safety was complete think of iti did not even exist let me but escape into my laboratory door give me but a second or two to mix and swallow the draught that
y reflections when as i have said a side light began to shine upon the subject from the laboratory table i began to perceive more deeply than it has ever yet been stated the trembling immateriality the mistlike transience of this seemingly so solid body in which we walk attired certain agents i found to have the power to shake and pluck back that fleshly vestment even as a wind might toss the curtains of a pavilion for two good reasons i will not enter deeply into this scientific branch of my conf
one  poole replied the lawyer if you say that it will become my duty to make certain much as i desire to spare your masters feelings much as i am puzzled by this note which seems to prove him to be still alive i shall consider it my duty to break in that door  ah mr utterson thats talking cried the butler  and now comes the second question resumed utterson who is going to do it  why you and me sir was the undaunted reply  thats very well
d utterson was amazed to find it a copy of a pious work for which jekyll had several times expressed a great esteem annotated in his own hand with startling blasphemies  next in the course of their review of the chamber the searchers came to the chevalglass into whose depths they looked with an involuntary horror but it was so turned as to show them nothing but the rosy glow playing on the roof the fire sparkling in a hundred repetitions along the glazed front of the presses and their own pale an
him off from his blackguardly surroundings this was the home of henry jekylls favourite of a man who was heir to a quarter of a million sterling  an ivoryfaced and silveryhaired old woman opened the door she had an evil face smoothed by hypocrisy but her manners were excellent yes she said this was mr hydes but he was not at home he had been in that night very late but he had gone away again in less than an hour there was nothing strange in that his habits were very irregular and he 
all my drugs were in the cabineta long journey down two pairs of stairs through the back passage across the open court and through the anatomical theatre from where i was then standing horrorstruck it might indeed be possible to cover my face but of what use was that when i was unable to conceal the alteration in my stature and then with an overpowering sweetness of relief it came back upon my mind that the servants were already used to the coming and going of my second self i had soon dressed
error of the gallows drove him continually to commit temporary suicide and return to his subordinate station of a part instead of a person but he loathed the necessity he loathed the despondency into which jekyll was now fallen and he resented the dislike with which he was himself regarded hence the apelike tricks that he would play me scrawling in my own hand blasphemies on the pages of my books burning the letters and destroying the portrait of my father and indeed had it not been for his fear o
net communicated separately by a second flight of stairs there were besides a few dark closets and a spacious cellar all these they now thoroughly examined each closet needed but a glance for all were empty and all by the dust that fell from their doors had stood long unopened the cellar indeed was filled with crazy lumber mostly dating from the times of the surgeon who was jekylls predecessor but even as they opened the door they were advertised of the uselessness of further search by the f

what i saw i heard what i heard and my soul sickened at it and yet now when that sight has faded from my eyes i ask myself if i believe it and i cannot answer my life is shaken to its roots sleep has left me the deadliest terror sits by me at all hours of the day and night and i feel that my days are numbered and that i must die and yet i shall die incredulous as for the moral turpitude that man unveiled to me even with tears of penitence i cannot even in memory dwell on it without a start o
t every mark of capacity and kindnessyou could see by his looks that he cherished for mr utterson a sincere and warm affection  i have been wanting to speak to you jekyll began the latter you know that will of yours  a close observer might have gathered that the topic was distasteful but the doctor carried it off gaily my poor utterson said he you are unfortunate in such a client i never saw a man so distressed as you were by my will unless it were that hidebound pedant
eem a very popular character observed the latter and now my good woman just let me and this gentleman have a look about us  in the whole extent of the house which but for the old woman remained otherwise empty mr hyde had only used a couple of rooms but these were furnished with luxury and good taste a closet was filled with wine the plate was of silver the napery elegant a good picture hung upon the walls a gift as utterson supposed from henry jekyll who was much of a connoisseur
e look so ugly that it brought out the sweat on me like running the people who had turned out were the girls own family and pretty soon the doctor for whom she had been sent put in his appearance well the child was not much the worse more frightened according to the sawbones and there you might have supposed would be an end to it but there was one curious circumstance i had taken a loathing to my gentleman at first sight so had the childs family which was only natural but the doctors

ooded awhile on his own past groping in all the corners of memory least by chance some jackinthebox of an old iniquity should leap to light there his past was fairly blameless few men could read the rolls of their life with less apprehension yet he was humbled to the dust by the many ill things he had done and raised up again into a sober and fearful gratitude by the many he had come so near to doing yet avoided and then by a return on his former subject he conceived a spark of hope this mast
eason a great chocolatecoloured pall lowered over heaven but the wind was continually charging and routing these embattled vapours so that as the cab crawled from street to street mr utterson beheld a marvelous number of degrees and hues of twilight for here it would be dark like the backend of evening and there would be a glow of a rich lurid brown like the light of some strange conflagration and here for a moment the fog would be quite broken up and a haggard shaft of daylight would glance

of my room in the square in vain that i recognised the pattern of the bed curtains and the design of the mahogany frame something still kept insisting that i was not where i was that i had not wakened where i seemed to be but in the little room in soho where i was accustomed to sleep in the body of edward hyde i smiled to myself and in my psychological way began lazily to inquire into the elements of this illusion occasionally even as i did so dropping back into a comfortable morning doze i was s
asured heaps of some white salt being laid on glass saucers as though for an experiment in which the unhappy man had been prevented  that is the same drug that i was always bringing him said poole and even as he spoke the kettle with a startling noise boiled over  this brought them to the fireside where the easychair was drawn cosily up and the tea things stood ready to the sitters elbow the very sugar in the cup there were several books on a shelf one lay beside the tea things open an
e covered his face for a moment with his hands  on his way out the lawyer stopped and had a word or two with poole by the bye said he there was a letter handed in today what was the messenger like but poole was positive nothing had come except by post and only circulars by that he added  this news sent off the visitor with his fears renewed plainly the letter had come by the laboratory door possibly indeed it had been written in the cabinet and if that were so it must be d
wyer stood awhile when mr hyde had left him the picture of disquietude then he began slowly to mount the street pausing every step or two and putting his hand to his brow like a man in mental perplexity the problem he was thus debating as he walked was one of a class that is rarely solved mr hyde was pale and dwarfish he gave an impression of deformity without any nameable malformation he had a displeasing smile he had borne himself to the lawyer with a sort of murderous mixture of timidity and b
s  that is the first part of the service now for the second you should be back if you set out at once on the receipt of this long before midnight but i will leave you that amount of margin not only in the fear of one of those obstacles that can neither be prevented nor foreseen but because an hour when your servants are in bed is to be preferred for what will then remain to do at midnight then i have to ask you to be alone in your consulting room to admit with your own hand into the house a m
 i described was to have full liberty and power about my house in the square and to parry mishaps i even called and made myself a familiar object in my second character i next drew up that will to which you so much objected so that if anything befell me in the person of dr jekyll i could enter on that of edward hyde without pecuniary loss and thus fortified as i supposed on every side i began to profit by the strange immunities of my position  men have before hired bravos to transact their crim
you so again continued the lawyer i have been learning something of young hyde  the large handsome face of dr jekyll grew pale to the very lips and there came a blackness about his eyes i do not care to hear more said he this is a matter i thought we had agreed to drop  what i heard was abominable said utterson  it can make no change you do not understand my position returned the doctor with a certain incoherency of manner i am painfully situated utterson
way to dr jekylls door where he was at once admitted by poole and carried down by the kitchen offices and across a yard which had once been a garden to the building which was indifferently known as the laboratory or dissecting rooms the doctor had bought the house from the heirs of a celebrated surgeon and his own tastes being rather chemical than anatomical had changed the destination of the block at the bottom of the garden it was the first time that the lawyer had been received in that part of
ed with a strong glow of courage drank off the potion  the most racking pangs succeeded a grinding in the bones deadly nausea and a horror of the spirit that cannot be exceeded at the hour of birth or death then these agonies began swiftly to subside and i came to myself as if out of a great sickness there was something strange in my sensations something indescribably new and from its very novelty incredibly sweet i felt younger lighter happier in body within i was conscious of a heady reckl

 was without efficiency you will learn from poole how i have had london ransacked it was in vain and i am now persuaded that my first supply was impure and that it was that unknown impurity which lent efficacy to the draught  about a week has passed and i am now finishing this statement under the influence of the last of the old powders this then is the last time short of a miracle that henry jekyll can think his own thoughts or see his own face now how sadly altered in the glass nor must i d
m on the intellectual side alone but now his imagination also was engaged or rather enslaved and as he lay and tossed in the gross darkness of the night and the curtained room mr enfields tale went by before his mind in a scroll of lighted pictures he would be aware of the great field of lamps of a nocturnal city then of the figure of a man walking swiftly then of a child running from the doctors and then these met and that human juggernaut trod the child down and passed on regardless of her
ge does not pass beyond that point others will follow others will outstrip me on the same lines and i hazard the guess that man will be ultimately known for a mere polity of multifarious incongruous and independent denizens i for my part from the nature of my life advanced infallibly in one direction and in one direction only it was on the moral side and in my own person that i learned to recognise the thorough and primitive duality of man i saw that of the two natures that contended in the fie
et speaking and we moved in a body to old dr denmans surgical theatre from which as you are doubtless aware jekylls private cabinet is most conveniently entered the door was very strong the lock excellent the carpenter avowed he would have great trouble and have to do much damage if force were to be used and the locksmith was near despair but this last was a handy fellow and after two hours work the door stood open the press marked e was unlocked and i took out the drawer had it fil

 door fell inwards on the carpet  the besiegers appalled by their own riot and the stillness that had succeeded stood back a little and peered in there lay the cabinet before their eyes in the quiet lamplight a good fire glowing and chattering on the hearth the kettle singing its thin strain a drawer or two open papers neatly set forth on the business table and nearer the fire the things laid out for tea the quietest room you would have said and but for the glazed presses full of chemicals th

ising and revoltingthis fresh disparity seemed but to fit in with and to reinforce it so that to my interest in the mans nature and character there was added a curiosity as to his origin his life his fortune and status in the world  these observations though they have taken so great a space to be set down in were yet the work of a few seconds my visitor was indeed on fire with sombre excitement  have you got it he cried have you got it and so lively was his impatience that he

 prince andrew entered his fathers dressing room not with the contemptuous look and manner he wore in drawing rooms but with the animated face with which he talked to pierre the old man was sitting on a large leathercovered chair wrapped in a powdering mantle entrusting his head to tkhon  ah heres the warrior wants to vanquish buonaparte said the old man shaking his powdered head as much as the tail which tkhon was holding fast to plait would allow  you at least must tackle

 piece of rudeness was more than alice could bear she got up in great disgust and walked off the dormouse fell asleep instantly and neither of the others took the least notice of her going though she looked back once or twice half hoping that they would call after her the last time she saw them they were trying to put the dormouse into the teapot  at any rate ill never go there again said alice as she picked her way through the wood its the stupidest teaparty i ever was at in al
lice  of course you dont the hatter said tossing his head contemptuously i dare say you never even spoke to time  perhaps not alice cautiously replied but i know i have to beat time when i learn music  ah that accounts for it said the hatter he wont stand beating now if you only kept on good terms with him hed do almost anything you liked with the clock for instance suppose it were nine oclock in the morning just time to begin lessons youd on
il that squeaked this of course alice could not stand and she went round the court and got behind him and very soon found an opportunity of taking it away she did it so quickly that the poor little juror it was bill the lizard could not make out at all what had become of it so after hunting all about for it he was obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day and this was of very little use as it left no mark on the slate  herald read the accusation said the king  on this
t try to find any and yet i dont know he went on spreading out the verses on his knee and looking at them with one eye i seem to see some meaning in them after all said i could not swim you cant swim can you he added turning to the knave  the knave shook his head sadly do i look like it he said which he certainly did not being made entirely of cardboard  all right so far said the king and he went on muttering over the verses to himself 
seriously ill have nothing more to do with you mind now the poor little thing sobbed again or grunted it was impossible to say which and they went on for some while in silence  alice was just beginning to think to herself now what am i to do with this creature when i get it home when it grunted again so violently that she looked down into its face in some alarm this time there could be no mistake about it it was neither more nor less than a pig and she felt that it would be 
he is gay as a lark and will talk in contemptuous tones of the shark but when the tide rises and sharks are around his voice has a timid and tremulous sound   thats different from what i used to say when i was a child said the gryphon  well i never heard it before said the mock turtle but it sounds uncommon nonsense  alice said nothing she had sat down with her face in her hands wondering if anything would ever happen in a natural way again  i should like to have i
im a poor man your majesty he began  youre a very poor speaker said the king  here one of the guineapigs cheered and was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court as that is rather a hard word i will just explain to you how it was done they had a large canvas bag which tied up at the mouth with strings into this they slipped the guineapig head first and then sat upon it  im glad ive seen that done thought alice ive so often read in the newsp
an till she was quite tired and out of breath and till the puppys bark sounded quite faint in the distance  and yet what a dear little puppy it was said alice as she leant against a buttercup to rest herself and fanned herself with one of the leaves i should have liked teaching it tricks very much ifif id only been the right size to do it oh dear id nearly forgotten that ive got to grow up again let me seehow is it to be managed i suppose i ought to eat or drink somet
 minute there was not even room for this and she tried the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door and the other arm curled round her head still she went on growing and as a last resource she put one arm out of the window and one foot up the chimney and said to herself now i can do no more whatever happens what will become of me  luckily for alice the little magic bottle had now had its full effect and she grew no larger still it was very uncomfortable and as there seeme
ce but she had not long to doubt for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the window and some of them hit her in the face ill put a stop to this she said to herself and shouted out youd better not do that again which produced another dead silence  alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor and a bright idea came into her head if i eat one of these cakes she thought its sure
 just under the window she suddenly spread out her hand and made a snatch in the air she did not get hold of anything but she heard a little shriek and a fall and a crash of broken glass from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a cucumberframe or something of the sort  next came an angry voicethe rabbitspat pat where are you and then a voice she had never heard before sure then im here digging for apples yer honour  digging for apples 
ee how he did it he did not look at all comfortable and it was certainly not becoming  and thats the jurybox thought alice and those twelve creatures she was obliged to say creatures you see because some of them were animals and some were birds i suppose they are the jurors she said this last word two or three times over to herself being rather proud of it for she thought and rightly too that very few little girls of her age knew the meaning of it at all howeve
ice again for this time the mouse was bristling all over and she felt certain it must be really offended we wont talk about her any more if youd rather not  we indeed cried the mouse who was trembling down to the end of his tail as if i would talk on such a subject our family always hated cats nasty low vulgar things dont let me hear the name again  i wont indeed said alice in a great hurry to change the subject of conversation are youare you fon
cking them up again as quickly as she could for the accident of the goldfish kept running in her head and she had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once and put back into the jurybox or they would die  the trial cannot proceed said the king in a very grave voice until all the jurymen are back in their proper placesall he repeated with great emphasis looking hard at alice as he said so  alice looked at the jurybox and saw that in her haste she had put the liza
en furiously throwing an inkstand at the lizard as she spoke the unfortunate little bill had left off writing on his slate with one finger as he found it made no mark but he now hastily began again using the ink that was trickling down his face as long as it lasted  then the words dont fit you said the king looking round the court with a smile there was a dead silence  its a pun the king added in an offended tone and everybody laughed let the jury consider their verdi
 here i am in the middle of one there ought to be a book written about me that there ought and when i grow up ill write onebut im grown up now she added in a sorrowful tone at least theres no room to grow up any more here  but then thought alice shall i never get any older than i am now thatll be a comfort one waynever to be an old womanbut thenalways to have lessons to learn oh i shouldnt like that  oh you foolish alice she answere
the table for it she found she could not possibly reach it she could see it quite plainly through the glass and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table but it was too slippery and when she had tired herself out with trying the poor little thing sat down and cried  come theres no use in crying like that said alice to herself rather sharply i advise you to leave off this minute she generally gave herself very good advice though she very seldom followed it and
dofof dogs the mouse did not answer so alice went on eagerly there is such a nice little dog near our house i should like to show you a little brighteyed terrier you know with oh such long curly brown hair and itll fetch things when you throw them and itll sit up and beg for its dinner and all sorts of thingsi cant remember half of themand it belongs to a farmer you know and he says its so useful its worth a hundred pounds he says it kills all the rats ando
id old fellow said the others  we must burn the house down said the rabbits voice and alice called out as loud as she could if you do ill set dinah at you  there was a dead silence instantly and alice thought to herself i wonder what they will do next if they had any sense theyd take the roof off after a minute or two they began moving about again and alice heard the rabbit say a barrowful will do to begin with  a barrowful of what thought ali
ne to listen to her the cat seemed to think that there was enough of it now in sight and no more of it appeared  i dont think they play at all fairly alice began in rather a complaining tone and they all quarrel so dreadfully one cant hear oneself speakand they dont seem to have any rules in particular at least if there are nobody attends to themand youve no idea how confusing it is all the things being alive for instance theres the arch ive got to go through next
w old it was and as the lory positively refused to tell its age there was no more to be said  at last the mouse who seemed to be a person of authority among them called out sit down all of you and listen to me ill soon make you dry enough they all sat down at once in a large ring with the mouse in the middle alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it for she felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon  ahem said the mouse with an important air a
 walking about at the other end of the groundand i should have croqueted the queens hedgehog just now only it ran away when it saw mine coming  how do you like the queen said the cat in a low voice  not at all said alice shes so extremely just then she noticed that the queen was close behind her listening so she went on likely to win that its hardly worth while finishing the game  the queen smiled and passed on  who are you talking to said th
es and was just going to leave the room when her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the lookingglass there was no label this time with the words drink me but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips i know something interesting is sure to happen she said to herself whenever i eat or drink anything so ill just see what this bottle does i do hope itll make me grow large again for really im quite tired of being such a tiny little thing  it did so i
ouse said the hatter went on looking anxiously round to see if he would deny it too but the dormouse denied nothing being fast asleep  after that continued the hatter i cut some more breadandbutter  but what did the dormouse say one of the jury asked  that i cant remember said the hatter  you must remember remarked the king or ill have you executed  the miserable hatter dropped his teacup and breadandbutter and went down on one knee 
hing or other but the great question is what  the great question certainly was what alice looked all round her at the flowers and the blades of grass but she did not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances there was a large mushroom growing near her about the same height as herself and when she had looked under it and on both sides of it and behind it it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it  she stretched 
 and said thats very curious  its all about as curious as it can be said the gryphon  it all came different the mock turtle repeated thoughtfully i should like to hear her try and repeat something now tell her to begin he looked at the gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of authority over alice  stand up and repeat tis the voice of the sluggard said the gryphon  how the creatures order one about and make one repeat lessons thought alice
fair warning shouted the queen stamping on the ground as she spoke either you or your head must be off and that in about half no time take your choice  the duchess took her choice and was gone in a moment  lets go on with the game the queen said to alice and alice was too much frightened to say a word but slowly followed her back to the croquetground  the other guests had taken advantage of the queens absence and were resting in the shade however the moment they saw her
written up somewhere  down down down there was nothing else to do so alice soon began talking again dinahll miss me very much tonight i should think dinah was the cat i hope theyll remember her saucer of milk at teatime dinah my dear i wish you were down here with me there are no mice in the air im afraid but you might catch a bat and thats very like a mouse you know but do cats eat bats i wonder and here alice began to get rather sleepy and went on saying 
ne inches high  for a minute or two she stood looking at the house and wondering what to do next when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the woodshe considered him to be a footman because he was in livery otherwise judging by his face only she would have called him a fishand rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles it was opened by another footman in livery with a round face and large eyes like a frog and both footmen alice noticed had powdered hair that curled all over 
ee inches is such a wretched height to be  it is a very good height indeed said the caterpillar angrily rearing itself upright as it spoke it was exactly three inches high  but im not used to it pleaded poor alice in a piteous tone and she thought of herself i wish the creatures wouldnt be so easily offended  youll get used to it in time said the caterpillar and it put the hookah into its mouth and began smoking again  this time alice waited patiently until i
up and picking the daisies when suddenly a white rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her  there was nothing so very remarkable in that nor did alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the rabbit say to itself oh dear oh dear i shall be late when she thought it over afterwards it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this but at the time it all seemed quite natural but when the rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoatpocket and looked at it and then h
id waving its right paw round lives a hatter and in that direction waving the other paw lives a march hare visit either you like theyre both mad  but i dont want to go among mad people alice remarked  oh you cant help that said the cat were all mad here im mad youre mad  how do you know im mad said alice  you must be said the cat or you wouldnt have come here  alice didnt think that proved it at all however s
s were still running on the song id have said to the porpoise keep back please we dont want you with us  they were obliged to have him with them the mock turtle said no wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise  wouldnt it really said alice in a tone of great surprise  of course not said the mock turtle why if a fish came to me and told me he was going a journey i should say with what porpoise  dont you mean purpose
we know it to be true thats the jury of coursei gave her one they gave him two why that must be what he did with the tarts you know  but it goes on they all returned from him to you said alice  why there they are said the king triumphantly pointing to the tarts on the table nothing can be clearer than that then againbefore she had this fit you never had fits my dear i think he said to the queen  never said the que
 you are secondly because theyre making such a noise inside no one could possibly hear you and certainly there was a most extraordinary noise going on withina constant howling and sneezing and every now and then a great crash as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces  please then said alice how am i to get in  there might be some sense in your knocking the footman went on without attending to her if we had the door between us for instance if you were in
 i might as well be at school at once however she got up and began to repeat it but her head was so full of the lobster quadrille that she hardly knew what she was saying and the words came very queer indeed  tis the voice of the lobster i heard him declare you have baked me too brown i must sugar my hair as a duck with its eyelids so he with his nose trims his belt and his buttons and turns out his toes  later editions continued as follows when the sands are all dry 
be no use their putting their heads down and saying come up again dear i shall only look up and say who am i then tell me that first and then if i like being that person ill come up if not ill stay down here till im somebody elsebut oh dear cried alice with a sudden burst of tears i do wish they would put their heads down i am so very tired of being all alone here  as she said this she looked down at her hands and was surprised to see that she had put on o
                twinkle twinkle   here the dormouse shook itself and began singing in its sleep twinkle twinkle twinkle twinkle and went on so long that they had to pinch it to make it stop  well id hardly finished the first verse said the hatter when the queen jumped up and bawled out hes murdering the time off with his head  how dreadfully savage exclaimed alice  and ever since that the hatter went on in a mournful tone he wont 
rily away from him and said to the knave turn them over  the knave did so very carefully with one foot  get up said the queen in a shrill loud voice and the three gardeners instantly jumped up and began bowing to the king the queen the royal children and everybody else  leave off that screamed the queen you make me giddy and then turning to the rosetree she went on what have you been doing here  may it please your majesty said two in a very humbl
the whiting said the mock turtle theyyouve seen them of course  yes said alice ive often seen them at dinn she checked herself hastily  i dont know where dinn may be said the mock turtle but if youve seen them so often of course you know what theyre like  i believe so alice replied thoughtfully they have their tails in their mouthsand theyre all over crumbs  youre wrong about the crumbs said the mock turtle c
oes when they passed too close and waving their forepaws to mark the time while the mock turtle sang this very slowly and sadly  will you walk a little faster said a whiting to a snail theres a porpoise close behind us and hes treading on my tail see how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance they are waiting on the shinglewill you come and join the dance will you wont you will you wont you will you join the dance will you wont you will you wont y
do a thing i ask its always six oclock now  a bright idea came into alices head is that the reason so many teathings are put out here she asked  yes thats it said the hatter with a sigh its always teatime and weve no time to wash the things between whiles  then you keep moving round i suppose said alice  exactly so said the hatter as the things get used up  but what happens when you come to the beginning again alice ventured t
you may not have lived much under the sea i havent said aliceand perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster alice began to say i once tasted but checked herself hastily and said no never so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a lobster quadrille is  no indeed said alice what sort of a dance is it  why said the gryphon you first form into a line along the seashore  two lines cried the mock t
ce its very interesting i never knew so much about a whiting before  i can tell you more than that if you like said the gryphon do you know why its called a whiting  i never thought about it said alice why  it does the boots and shoes the gryphon replied very solemnly  alice was thoroughly puzzled does the boots and shoes she repeated in a wondering tone  why what are your shoes done with said the gryphon i mean what makes them 
ut it seems to be a letter written by the prisoner toto somebody  it must have been that said the king unless it was written to nobody which isnt usual you know  who is it directed to said one of the jurymen  it isnt directed at all said the white rabbit in fact theres nothing written on the outside he unfolded the paper as he spoke and added it isnt a letter after all its a set of verses  are they in the prisoners handwriting
 and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back however it was over at last and they sat down again in a ring and begged the mouse to tell them something more  you promised to tell me your history you know said alice and why it is you hatec and d she added in a whisper half afraid that it would be offended again  mine is a long and a sad tale said the mouse turning to alice and sighing  it is a long tail certainly said alice looking down with wonder
d seem to beor if youd like it put more simplynever imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might appear to others that what you were or might have been was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be otherwise  i think i should understand that better alice said very politely if i had it written down but i cant quite follow it as you say it  thats nothing to what i could say if i chose the duchess replied in a pleased t
ll us a story said the march hare  yes please do pleaded alice  and be quick about it added the hatter or youll be asleep again before its done  once upon a time there were three little sisters the dormouse began in a great hurry and their names were elsie lacie and tillie and they lived at the bottom of a well  what did they live on said alice who always took a great interest in questions of eating and drinking  they lived on treacle sa
ome mischief or else youd have signed your name like an honest man  there was a general clapping of hands at this it was the first really clever thing the king had said that day  that proves his guilt said the queen  it proves nothing of the sort said alice why you dont even know what theyre about  read them said the king  the white rabbit put on his spectacles where shall i begin please your majesty he asked  begin at the beginning the king
nt your majesty means of course he said in a very respectful tone but frowning and making faces at him as he spoke  unimportant of course i meant the king hastily said and went on to himself in an undertone  importantunimportantunimportantimportant as if he were trying which word sounded best  some of the jury wrote it down important and some unimportant alice could see this as she was near enough to look over their slates but it doesnt matter a 
then keep tight hold of its right ear and left foot so as to prevent its undoing itself she carried it out into the open air if i dont take this child away with me thought alice theyre sure to kill it in a day or two wouldnt it be murder to leave it behind she said the last words out loud and the little thing grunted in reply it had left off sneezing by this time dont grunt said alice thats not at all a proper way of expressing yourself  the baby grunted
hen a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurry a large pigeon had flown into her face and was beating her violently with its wings  serpent screamed the pigeon  im not a serpent said alice indignantly let me alone  serpent i say again repeated the pigeon but in a more subdued tone and added with a kind of sob ive tried every way and nothing seems to suit them  i havent the least idea what youre talking about said alice  ive tried the r
od deal this fireplace is narrow to be sure but i think i can kick a little  she drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could and waited till she heard a little animal she couldnt guess of what sort it was scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her then saying to herself this is bill she gave one sharp kick and waited to see what would happen next  the first thing she heard was a general chorus of there goes bill then the rabbits voice along
e on hearing this but all he said was why is a raven like a writingdesk  come we shall have some fun now thought alice im glad theyve begun asking riddlesi believe i can guess that she added aloud  do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it said the march hare  exactly so said alice  then you should say what you mean the march hare went on  i do alice hastily replied at leastat least i mean what i saythats t
oots of trees and ive tried banks and ive tried hedges the pigeon went on without attending to her but those serpents theres no pleasing them  alice was more and more puzzled but she thought there was no use in saying anything more till the pigeon had finished  as if it wasnt trouble enough hatching the eggs said the pigeon but i must be on the lookout for serpents night and day why i havent had a wink of sleep these three weeks  im very sorry youv
mid voice at her side she was walking by the white rabbit who was peeping anxiously into her face  very said alice wheres the duchess  hush hush said the rabbit in a low hurried tone he looked anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke and then raised himself upon tiptoe put his mouth close to her ear and whispered shes under sentence of execution  what for said alice  did you say what a pity the rabbit asked  no i didnt said alic
he same thing you know  not the same thing a bit said the hatter you might just as well say that i see what i eat is the same thing as i eat what i see  you might just as well say added the march hare that i like what i get is the same thing as i get what i like  you might just as well say added the dormouse who seemed to be talking in his sleep that i breathe when i sleep is the same thing as i sleep when i breathe  i
assembled about themall sorts of little birds and beasts as well as the whole pack of cards the knave was standing before them in chains with a soldier on each side to guard him and near the king was the white rabbit with a trumpet in one hand and a scroll of parchment in the other in the very middle of the court was a table with a large dish of tarts upon it they looked so good that it made alice quite hungry to look at themi wish theyd get the trial done she thought and hand

 and by an irresistible association of ideas the doctor allowed himself to be carried beyond the bounds of logic and of reason after having established in his own mind what he should not have done the next question was what he should do then would it be impossible to retrace his steps were there not currents higher up that would waft him to less arid regions well informed with regard to the countries over which he had passed he was utterly ignorant of those to come and thus his conscience spea

reasoner       used then to excite in the practical man        anything good he asked        the biggest thing for years said holmes we have two hours       before we need think of starting i think we might employ it in       getting some dinner and then lestrade we will take the london       fog out of your throat by giving you a breath of the pure night       air of dartmoor never been there ah well i dont suppose you       will forget your first visit        one of sherl
les and       his death gave us a shock and made these surroundings very       painful to us i fear that we shall never again be easy in our       minds at baskerville hall        but what do you intend to do        i have no doubt sir that we shall succeed in establishing       ourselves in some business sir charless generosity has given us       the means to do so and now sir perhaps i had best show you to       your rooms        a square balustraded gallery ran round the top 
a little       dullless for you perhaps than for your sister        no no i am never dull said she quickly        we have books we have our studies and we have interesting       neighbours dr mortimer is a most learned man in his own line       poor sir charles was also an admirable companion we knew him       well and miss him more than i can tell do you think that i       should intrude if i were to call this afternoon and make the       acquaintance of sir henry        
 the settled       order of nature        for example        i find that before the terrible event occurred several people       had seen a creature upon the moor which corresponds with this       baskerville demon and which could not possibly be any animal       known to science they all agreed that it was a huge creature       luminous ghastly and spectral i have crossexamined these men       one of them a hardheaded countryman one a farrier and one a       moorland farmer who al
ifficulties to this one       purpose i must now devote all my energies        my first impulse was to tell sir henry all my plans my second       and wisest one is to play my own game and speak as little as       possible to anyone he is silent and distrait his nerves have       been strangely shaken by that sound upon the moor i will say       nothing to add to his anxieties but i will take my own steps to       attain my own end        we had a small scene this morning after breakfast barrymore

ard it once or twice before but never quite so       loud        i looked round with a chill of fear in my heart at the huge       swelling plain mottled with the green patches of rushes nothing       stirred over the vast expanse save a pair of ravens which       croaked loudly from a tor behind us        you are an educated man you dont believe such nonsense as       that said i what do you think is the cause of so strange a       sound        bogs make queer noises someti

 the heart       of the mystery        the extract from my private diary which forms the last chapter       has brought my narrative up to the eighteenth of october a time       when these strange events began to move swiftly towards their       terrible conclusion the incidents of the next few days are       indelibly graven upon my recollection and i can tell them       without reference to the notes made at the time i start them       from the day which succeeded that upon which i had established   
    hidingplace for the creature here he kennelled it and waited       his chance        but it was some time coming the old gentleman could not be       decoyed outside of his grounds at night several times stapleton       lurked about with his hound but without avail it was during       these fruitless quests that he or rather his ally was seen by       peasants and that the legend of the demon dog received a new       confirmation he had hoped that his wife might lure sir charles       to h
then the clothes have been the poor devils death said he it       is clear enough that the hound has been laid on from some article       of sir henrysthe boot which was abstracted in the hotel in all       probabilityand so ran this man down there is one very singular       thing however how came selden in the darkness to know that       the hound was on his trail        he heard him        to hear a hound upon the moor would not work a hard man like       this con
retty clear signs that this will not be wanting if the lady is       willing for i have seldom seen a man more infatuated with a       woman than he is with our beautiful neighbour miss stapleton       and yet the course of true love does not run quite as smoothly as       one would under the circumstances expect today for example its       surface was broken by a very unexpected ripple which has caused       our friend considerable perplexity and annoyance        after the conversation which i have
ton this morning now mr holmes what would you advise       me to do with him        why should he not go to the home of his fathers        it seems natural does it not and yet consider that every       baskerville who goes there meets with an evil fate i feel sure       that if sir charles could have spoken with me before his death he       would have warned me against bringing this the last of the old       race and the heir to great wealth to that deadly place and yet       it ca
 could result from it but       with you there is no reason why i should not be perfectly frank        the moor is very sparsely inhabited and those who live near       each other are thrown very much together for this reason i saw a       good deal of sir charles baskerville with the exception of mr       frankland of lafter hall and mr stapleton the naturalist       there are no other men of education within many miles sir       charles was a retiring man but the chance of his illness brou
ble to help you as you say       that he has done        she met my difficulty with the utmost readiness        there were several gentlemen who knew my sad history and united       to help me one was mr stapleton a neighbour and intimate       friend of sir charless he was exceedingly kind and it was       through him that sir charles learned about my affairs        i knew already that sir charles baskerville had made stapleton       his almoner upon several occasions so the ladys 
ame       breath that it is useless to investigate sir charless death and       that you desire me to do it        i did not say that i desired you to do it        then how can i assist you        by advising me as to what i should do with sir henry       baskerville who arrives at waterloo stationdr mortimer looked       at his watchin exactly one hour and a quarter        he being the heir        yes on the death of sir charles we inquired for this yo
e thing and that is       that we have not been shadowed during the last two days we have       never gone out without keeping a sharp watch and no one could       have escaped our notice        you have always kept together i presume        except yesterday afternoon i usually give up one day to pure       amusement when i come to town so i spent it at the museum of the       college of surgeons        and i went to look at the folk in the park said baskerville        but
 which the upper floor and the roof floated like a strange ship       upon a shadowy sea holmes struck his hand passionately upon the       rock in front of us and stamped his feet in his impatience        if he isnt out in a quarter of an hour the path will be       covered in half an hour we wont be able to see our hands in       front of us        shall we move farther back upon higher ground        yes i think it would be as well        so as the fogbank flowed onward we 
a great deal more than i do about my own       affairs        you shall share our knowledge before you leave this room sir       henry i promise you that said sherlock holmes we will       confine ourselves for the present with your permission to this       very interesting document which must have been put together and       posted yesterday evening have you yesterdays times watson        it is here in the corner        might i trouble you for itthe inside page pl

he past sir henry and       dr mortimer were however in london on their way to that long       voyage which had been recommended for the restoration of his       shattered nerves they had called upon us that very afternoon so       that it was natural that the subject should come up for       discussion        the whole course of events said holmes from the point of       view of the man who called himself stapleton was simple and       direct although to us who had no means in the begi

       evidence of the barrymores shows that this had been his             custom on the fourth of may sir charles had declared his             intention of starting next day for london and had ordered             barrymore to prepare his luggage  that night he went out             as usual for his nocturnal walk in the course of which he             was in the habit of smoking a cigar  he never returned              at twelve oclock barrymore finding the hall door still             open became a
ough if all the fiends of the       pit were loose upon the moor        we stumbled slowly along in the darkness with the black loom of       the craggy hills around us and the yellow speck of light burning       steadily in front there is nothing so deceptive as the distance       of a light upon a pitchdark night and sometimes the glimmer       seemed to be far away upon the horizon and sometimes it might       have been within a few yards of us but at last we could see       whence it came and
pped then       once more the footsteps approached and a shadow fell across the       opening of the hut        it is a lovely evening my dear watson said a wellknown       voice i really think that you will be more comfortable outside       than in        for a moment or two i sat breathless hardly able to believe my       ears then my senses and my voice came back to me while a       crushing weight of responsibility seemed in an instant to be       lifted from my soul that cold in

and it rained and it rained piglet told himself that never in all his life and he was goodness knows how oldthree was it or fournever had he seen so much rain days and days and days  if only he thought as he looked out of the window i had been in poohs house or christopher robins house or rabbits house when it began to rain then i should have had company all this time instead of being here all alone with nothing to do except wonder when it will stop and he imagined himself wit
hen the rain began pooh was asleep it rained and it rained and it rained and he slept and he slept and he slept he had had a tiring day you remember how he discovered the north pole well he was so proud of this that he asked christopher robin if there were any other poles such as a bear of little brain might discover  theres a south pole said christopher robin and i expect theres an east pole and a west pole though people dont like talking about them  pooh was very excited when he heard 
d then sliding away suddenly so that the next might have his turn through them and between them the sun shone bravely and a copse which had worn its firs all the year round seemed old and dowdy now beside the new green lace which the beeches had put on so prettily through copse and spinney marched bear down open slopes of gorse and heather over rocky beds of streams up steep banks of sandstone into the heather again and so at last tired and hungry to the hundred acre wood for it was in the hundred
 its an ambush pooh when people jump at you suddenly explained piglet  pooh who now knew what an ambush was said that a gorsebush had sprung at him suddenly one day when he fell off a tree and he had taken six days to get all the prickles out of himself  we are not talking about gorsebushes said owl a little crossly  i am said pooh  they were climbing very cautiously up the stream now going from rock to rock and after they had gone a little way they came to a place where the banks w
eston pie  eeyore still said nothing at all so pooh hummed the third verse quietly to himself      cottleston cottleston cottleston pie     why does a chicken i dont know why     ask me a riddle and i reply     cottleston cottleston cottleston pie  thats right said eeyore sing umtytiddly umtytoo here we go gathering nuts and may enjoy yourself  i am said pooh  some can said eeyore  why whats the matter  is anything the matter  you seem so sad eeyore  s
r bread he was so excited that he said both and then so as not to seem greedy he added but dont bother about the bread please and for a long time after that he said nothing  until at last humming to himself in a rather sticky voice he got up shook rabbit lovingly by the paw and said that he must be going on  must you said rabbit politely  well said pooh i could stay a little longer if itif you and he tried very hard to look in the direction of the larder  as a matter 
other side then he looked at himself in the water again  as i thought he said no better from this side but nobody minds nobody cares pathetic thats what it is  there was a crackling noise in the bracken behind him and out came pooh  good morning eeyore said pooh  good morning pooh bear said eeyore gloomily if it is a good morning he said which i doubt said he  why whats the matter  nothing pooh bear nothing we cant all and some of us dont thats all there i
aid lost all feeling numbed it thats what its done numbed it well as long as nobody minds i suppose its all right  poor old eeyore ill dry it for you said christopher robin and he took out his handkerchief and rubbed it up  thank you christopher robin youre the only one who seems to understand about tails they dont thinkthats what the matter with some of these others theyve no imagination a tail isnt a tail to them its just a little bit extra at the back  never mind 
streams of the forest were tinkling happily to find themselves their own pretty shape again and the little pools lay dreaming of the life they had seen and the big things they had done and in the warmth and quiet of the forest the cuckoo was trying over his voice carefully and listening to see if he liked it and woodpigeons were complaining gently to themselves in their lazy comfortable way that it was the other fellows fault but it didnt matter very much on such a day as this christopher robin whis
way until he came back to where he was at first and then he put his head down and looked between his front legs and at last he said with a long sad sigh i believe youre right  of course im right said pooh  that accounts for a good deal said eeyore gloomily it explains everything no wonder  you must have left it somewhere said winniethepooh  somebody must have taken it said eeyore how like them he added after a long silence  pooh felt that he ought to say something helpf
 are weyou pooh and you piglet and meand suddenly  and eeyore said pooh  and eeyoreand then suddenly  and owl said pooh  and owland then all of a sudden  oh and eeyore said pooh i was forgetting him  hereweare said rabbit very slowly and carefully allofus and then suddenly we wake up one morning and what do we find we find a strange animal among us an animal of whom we have never even heard before an animal who carries her family about with 
 all say aha  all three of us  yes  oh  why whats the trouble piglet  nothing said piglet as long as we all three say it as long as we all three say it said piglet i dont mind he said but i shouldnt care to say aha by myself it wouldnt sound nearly so well by the way he said you are quite sure about what you said about the winter months  the winter months  yes only being fierce in the winter months  oh yes yes thats all right well pooh 
do you mind if i use your back legs as a towelhorse because i mean there they aredoing nothingand it would be very convenient just to hang the towels on them  a week said pooh gloomily what about meals  im afraid no meals said christopher robin because of getting thin quicker but we will read to you  bear began to sigh and then found he couldnt because he was so tightly stuck and a tear rolled down his eye as he said  then would you read a sustaining book such as would
of course they are and rabbit and kanga and all of you its an expedition thats what an expedition means a long line of everybody youd better tell the others to get ready while i see if my guns all right and we must all bring provisions  bring what  things to eat  oh said pooh happily i thought you said provisions ill go and tell them and he stumped off  the first person he met was rabbit  hallo rabbit he said is that you  lets pretend it isnt said rabbit and see 
  many happy returns of the day called out pooh forgetting that he had said it already  thank you pooh im having them said eeyore gloomily  ive brought you a little present said pooh excitedly  ive had it said eeyore  pooh had now splashed across the stream to eeyore and piglet was sitting a little way off his head in his paws snuffling to himself  its a useful pot said pooh here it is and its got a very happy birthday with love from pooh written on it thats what all t
dnt i suppose its just practice he thought i wonder if kanga will have to practise too so as to understand it  theres just one thing said piglet fidgeting a bit i was talking to christopher robin and he said that a kanga was generally regarded as one of the fiercer animals i am not frightened of fierce animals in the ordinary way but it is well known that if one of the fiercer animals is deprived of its young it becomes as fierce as two of the fiercer animals in which case aha is
been there hes been sitting on a branch of his tree outside his house with nine pots of honey but he isnt there now  oh pooh cried christopher robin where are you  here i am said a growly voice behind him  pooh  they rushed into each others arms  how did you get here pooh asked christopher robin when he was ready to talk again  on my boat said pooh proudly i had a very important missage sent me in a bottle and owing to having got some water in my eyes i couldnt read 
to be  oh said pooh  he took his head out of the hole and had another think and then he put it back and said  well could you very kindly tell me where rabbit is  he has gone to see his friend pooh bear who is a great friend of his  but this is me said bear very much surprised  what sort of me  pooh bear  are you sure said rabbit still more surprised  quite quite sure said pooh  oh well then come in  so pooh pushed and pushed and pushed his way through the hole
mnly the expedition is over you have found the north pole  oh said pooh  eeyore was sitting with his tail in the water when they all got back to him  tell roo to be quick somebody he said my tails getting cold i dont want to mention it but i just mention it i dont want to complain but there it is my tails cold  here i am squeaked roo  oh there you are  did you see me swimming  eeyore took his tail out of the water and swished it from side to side  as i expected he s
 just said to myself coming along i wonder if christopher robin has such a thing as a balloon about him i just said it to myself thinking of balloons and wondering  what do you want a balloon for you said  winniethepooh looked round to see that nobody was listening put his paw to his mouth and said in a deep whisper honey  but you dont get honey with balloons  i do said pooh  well it just happened that you had been to a party the day before at the house of your friend piglet
ing all numb and could you do anything to help  no said pooh that wasnt me he said he thought for a little and then suggested helpfully perhaps it was somebody else  well thank him for me when you see him  pooh looked anxiously at christopher robin  poohs found the north pole said christopher robin isnt that lovely  pooh looked modestly down  is that it said eeyore  yes said christopher robin  is that what we were looking for  yes said pooh  oh said eeyore 
n you got used to it  i knew it wasnt piglet said kanga i wonder who it can be  perhaps its some relation of poohs said christopher robin what about a nephew or an uncle or something  kanga agreed that this was probably what it was and said that they would have to call it by some name  i shall call it pootel said christopher robin henry pootel for short  and just when it was decided henry pootel wriggled out of kangas arms and jumped to the ground to his great joy christopher r
t open the mouth dear or the soap goes in said kanga there what did i tell you  youyouyou did it on purpose spluttered piglet as soon as he could speak again  and then accidentally had another mouthful of lathery flannel  thats right dear dont say anything said kanga and in another minute piglet was out of the bath and being rubbed dry with a towel  now said kanga theres your medicine and then bed  wwwhat medicine said piglet  to make you grow big and strong d
ife of a bear           sing ho for the life of a bear     i dont much mind if it rains or snows     cos ive got a lot of honey on my nice new nose     i dont much care if it snows or thaws     cos ive got a lot of honey on my nice clean paws           sing ho for a bear           sing ho for a pooh     and ill have a little something in an hour or two  he was so pleased with this song that he sang it all the way to the top of the forest and if i go on singing it much longer he though
tled in a special way he had and owl came flying out of the hundred acre wood to see what was wanted  owl said christopher robin i am going to give a party  you are are you said owl  and its to be a special sort of party because its because of what pooh did when he did what he did to save piglet from the flood  oh thats what its for is it said owl  yes so will you tell pooh as quickly as you can and all the others because it will be tomorrow  oh it will will it said o
ul about it but didnt quite know what so he decided to do something helpful instead  eeyore he said solemnly i winniethepooh will find your tail for you  thank you pooh answered eeyore youre a real friend said he not like some he said  so winniethepooh went off to find eeyores tail  it was a fine spring morning in the forest as he started out little soft clouds played happily in a blue sky skipping from time to time in front of the sun as if they had come to put it out an
 going on an expotition said pooh eagerly i dont think ive ever been on one of those where are we going to on this expotition  expedition silly old bear its got an x in it  oh said pooh i know but he didnt really  were going to discover the north pole  oh said pooh again what is the north pole he asked  its just a thing you discover said christopher robin carelessly not being quite sure himself  oh i see said pooh are bears any good at discovering it  
pher robin had told him about a man on a desert island who had written something in a bottle and thrown it in the sea and piglet thought that if he wrote something in a bottle and threw it in the water perhaps somebody would come and rescue him  he left the window and began to search his house all of it that wasnt under water and at last he found a pencil and a small piece of dry paper and a bottle with a cork to it and he wrote on one side of the paper                                   help    
pole look like  well said rabbit stroking his whiskers now youre asking me  i did know once only ive sort of forgotten said christopher robin carelessly  its a funny thing said rabbit but ive sort of forgotten too although i did know once  i suppose its just a pole stuck in the ground  sure to be a pole said rabbit because of calling it a pole and if its a pole well i should think it would be sticking in the ground shouldnt you because thered be nowhere else t
 quite know what he was thinking about so when winniethepooh came stumping along eeyore was very glad to be able to stop thinking for a little in order to say how do you do in a gloomy manner to him  and how are you said winniethepooh  eeyore shook his head from side to side  not very how he said i dont seem to have felt at all how for a long time  dear dear said pooh im sorry about that lets have a look at you  so eeyore stood there gazing sadly at the ground and winn
n your house  i think so  i wish you would bring it out here and walk up and down with it and look up at me every now and then and say tuttut it looks like rain i think if you did that it would help the deception which we are practising on these bees  well you laughed to yourself silly old bear but you didnt say it aloud because you were so fond of him and you went home for your umbrella  oh there you are called down winniethepooh as soon as you got back to the tree i was 
ought that perhaps only the forest part of it had and then he thought that perhaps only he had and he was now alone in the moon or somewhere and would never see christopher robin or pooh or eeyore again and then he thought well even if im in the moon i neednt be face downwards all the time so he got cautiously up and looked about him  he was still in the forest  well thats funny he thought i wonder what that bang was i couldnt have made such a noise just falling down and wheres my
friday so off they went together  there was a small spinney of larch trees just here and it seemed as if the two woozles if that is what they were had been going round this spinney so round this spinney went pooh and piglet after them piglet passing the time by telling pooh what his grandfather trespassers w had done to remove stiffness after tracking and how his grandfather trespassers w had suffered in his later years from shortness of breath and other matters of interest and pooh wondering what
 and hoarfrost twinkles on the trees     how very readily one sees     that these are whosebut whose are these      on friday  yes it is isnt it said kanga not waiting to hear what happened on friday just one more jump roo dear and then we really must be going  rabbit gave pooh a hurryingup sort of nudge  talking of poetry said pooh quickly have you ever noticed that tree right over there  where said kanga now roo  right over there said pooh pointing behind k
pher robin of course hell use his front door again  good said rabbit  if we cant pull you out pooh we might push you back  rabbit scratched his whiskers thoughtfully and pointed out that when once pooh was pushed back he was back and of course nobody was more glad to see pooh than he was still there it was some lived in trees and some lived underground and  you mean id never get out said pooh  i mean said rabbit that having got so far it seems a pity to waste it 
rain but he knows things he would know the right thing to do when surrounded by water theres rabbit he hasnt learnt in books but he can always think of a clever plan theres kanga she isnt clever kanga isnt but she would be so anxious about roo that she would do a good thing to do without thinking about it and then theres eeyore and eeyore is so miserable anyhow that he wouldnt mind about this but i wonder what christopher robin would do  then suddenly he remembered a story which christo
this and suggested that they should have an expotition to discover the east pole but christopher robin had thought of something else to do with kanga so pooh went out to discover the east pole by himself whether he discovered it or not i forget but he was so tired when he got home that in the very middle of his supper after he had been eating for little more than halfanhour he fell fast asleep in his chair and slept and slept and slept  then suddenly he was dreaming he was at the east pole an
 on  thats bad said pooh  do you think you could very kindly lean against me cos i keep pulling so hard that i fall over backwards  pooh sat down dug his feet into the ground and pushed hard against christopher robins back and christopher robin pushed hard against his and pulled and pulled at his boot until he had got it on  and thats that said pooh what do we do next  we are all going on an expedition said christopher robin as he got up and brushed himself thank you pooh 
glet looked down  help help cried piglet a heffalump a horrible heffalump and he scampered off as hard as he could still crying out help help a herrible hoffalump hoff hoff a hellible horralump holl holl a hoffable hellerump and he didnt stop crying and scampering until he got to christopher robins house  whatevers the matter piglet said christopher robin who was just getting up  heff said piglet breathing so hard that he could hardly speak a heffa heffa heffalump
ine all rabbits friendsandrelations  i didnt ask them explained rabbit carelessly they just came they always do they can march at the end after eeyore  what i say said eeyore is that its unsettling i didnt want to come on this expowhat pooh said i only came to oblige but here i am and if i am the end of the expowhat were talking aboutthen let me be the end but if every time i want to sit down for a little rest i have to brush away half a dozen of rabbits smaller frien
d christopher robin  thats the end of that one there are others  about pooh and me  and piglet and rabbit and all of you dont you remember  i do remember and then when i try to remember i forget  that day when pooh and piglet tried to catch the heffalump  they didnt catch it did they  no  pooh couldnt because he hasnt any brain did i catch it  well that comes into the story  christopher robin nodded  i do remember he said only pooh doesnt very well so th
e thought for a long time and then he said  christopher robin you must shoot the balloon with your gun have you got your gun  of course i have you said but if i do that it will spoil the balloon you said  but if you dont said pooh i shall have to let go and that would spoil me  when he put it like this you saw how it was and you aimed very carefully at the balloon and fired  ow said pooh  did i miss you asked  you didnt exactly miss said pooh but you missed
let trotted to his house trespassers w while pooh made his preparations for bed  some hours later just as the night was beginning to steal away pooh woke up suddenly with a sinking feeling he had had that sinking feeling before and he knew what it meant he was hungry so he went to the larder and he stood on a chair and reached up to the top shelf and foundnothing  thats funny he thought i know i had a jar of honey there a full jar full of honey right up to the top and it had hunny wr
y to say anything  hallo eeyore said roo  eeyore nodded gloomily at him it will rain soon you see if it doesnt he said  roo looked to see if it didnt and it didnt so he said hallo owland owl said hallo my little fellow in a kindly way and went on telling christopher robin about an accident which had nearly happened to a friend of his whom christopher robin didnt know and kanga said to roo drink up your milk first dear and talk afterwards so roo who was drinking his milk
u have a green balloon they might think you were only part of the tree and not notice you and if you have a blue balloon they might think you were only part of the sky and not notice you and the question is which is most likely  wouldnt they notice you underneath the balloon you asked  they might or they might not said winniethepooh you never can tell with bees he thought for a moment and said i shall try to look like a small black cloud that will deceive them  then you had b
he washed the pot out and dried it while owl licked the end of his pencil and wondered how to spell birthday  can you read pooh he asked a little anxiously theres a notice about knocking and ringing outside my door which christopher robin wrote could you read it  christopher robin told me what it said and then i could  well ill tell you what this says and then youll be able to  so owl wrote  and this is what he wrote                   hipy papy bthuthdth thuthda bthuthdy
nside him were saying now then pooh time for a little something  dear dear said pooh i didnt know it was as late as that so he sat down and took the top off his jar of honey lucky i brought this with me he thought many a bear going out on a warm day like this would never have thought of bringing a little something with him and he began to eat  now let me see he thought as he took his last lick of the inside of the jar where was i going ah yes eeyore he got up slowly  and

establish himself on that which is in his own control and not in that of others he must endeavour only to avoid hatred as is noted  every one admits how praiseworthy it is in a prince to keep faith and to live with integrity and not with craft nevertheless our experience has been that those princes who have done great things have held good faith of little account and have known how to circumvent the intellect of men by craft and in the end have overcome those who have relied on their word you must k
oken that they are giving more thought to themselves than to you and a prince ought to guard against such and to fear them as if they were open enemies because in adversity they always help to ruin him  therefore one who becomes a prince through the favour of the people ought to keep them friendly and this he can easily do seeing they only ask not to be oppressed by him but one who in opposition to the people becomes a prince by the favour of the nobles ought above everything to seek to win the 
leaves us to direct the other half or perhaps a little less  i compare her to one of those raging rivers which when in flood overflows the plains sweeping away trees and buildings bearing away the soil from place to place everything flies before it all yield to its violence without being able in any way to withstand it and yet though its nature be such it does not follow therefore that men when the weather becomes fair shall not make provision both with defences and barriers in such a manner 
  therefore it is unnecessary for a prince to have all the good qualities i have enumerated but it is very necessary to appear to have them and i shall dare to say this also that to have them and always to observe them is injurious and that to appear to have them is useful to appear merciful faithful humane religious upright and to be so but with a mind so framed that should you require not to be so you may be able and know how to change to the opposite  and you have to understand this that a

it is necessary to consider another point in examining the character of these principalities that is whether a prince has such power that in case of need he can support himself with his own resources or whether he has always need of the assistance of others and to make this quite clear i say that i consider those who are able to support themselves by their own resources who can either by abundance of men or money raise a sufficient army to join battle against any one who comes to attack them and i 
 visors it was a case of unready soldiers being attacked by ready and they were assailed with such vigour that with difficulty they could hold their own although some few of them got through when the noise of the fighting reached the florentine camp below it was filled with confusion the cavalry and infantry became inextricably mixed the captains were unable to get their men either backward or forward owing to the narrowness of the pass and amid all this tumult no one knew what ought to be done or

ing hated by someone they ought in the first place to avoid being hated by every one and when they cannot compass this they ought to endeavour with the utmost diligence to avoid the hatred of the most powerful therefore those emperors who through inexperience had need of special favour adhered more readily to the soldiers than to the people a course which turned out advantageous to them or not accordingly as the prince knew how to maintain authority over them  from these causes it arose that marcu

as he went all the chances that could befall an army he would listen to their opinion and state his confirming it with reasons so that by these continual discussions there could never arise in time of war any unexpected circumstances that he could not deal with  but to exercise the intellect the prince should read histories and study there the actions of illustrious men to see how they have borne themselves in war to examine the causes of their victories and defeat so as to avoid the latter and i

tioned above i say that every prince ought to desire to be considered clement and not cruel nevertheless he ought to take care not to misuse this clemency cesare borgia was considered cruel notwithstanding his cruelty reconciled the romagna unified it and restored it to peace and loyalty and if this be rightly considered he will be seen to have been much more merciful than the florentine people who to avoid a reputation for cruelty permitted pistoia to be destroyed therefore a prince so long a

 my poor unhappy man whither are you going over this mountain top alone and without knowing the way your men are shut up in circes pigstyes like so many wild boars in their lairs you surely do not fancy that you can set them free i can tell you that you will never get back and will have to stay there with the rest of them but never mind i will protect you and get you out of your difficulty take this herb which is one of great virtue and keep it about you when you go to circes house it 
court or i will give you egypt and cyprus over again for your insolence and importunity you have begged of all the others and they have given you lavishly for they have abundance round them and it is easy to be free with other peoples property when there is plenty of it  on this ulysses began to move off and said your looks my fine sir are better than your breeding if you were in your own house you would not spare a poor man so much as a pinch of salt for though you are in another ma

viled him outright and said i gather then that you are unskilled in any of the many sports that men generally delight in i suppose you are one of those grasping traders that go about in ships as captains or merchants and who think of nothing but of their outward freights and homeward cargoes there does not seem to be much of the athlete about you  for shame sir answered ulysses fiercely you are an insolent fellowso true is it that the gods do not grace all men alike in speech p
hamed of yourself how can you expect people to come see you any more if you treat them in this way  he then took the cup and drank he was so delighted with the taste of the wine that he begged me for another bowl full be so kind he said as to give me some more and tell me your name at once i want to make you a present that you will be glad to have we have wine even in this country for our soil grows grapes and the sun ripens them but this drinks like nectar and ambrosia all in one
alcinous therefore said to his servant pontonous mix some wine and hand it round to everybody that we may offer a prayer to father jove and speed our guest upon his way  pontonous mixed the wine and handed it to every one in turn the others each from his own seat made a drinkoffering to the blessed gods that live in heaven but ulysses rose and placed the double cup in the hands of queen arete  farewell queen said he henceforward and for ever till age and death the common lot of

 finding it out but as time wore on and she was now in her fourth year in the waning of moons and many days had been accomplished one of her maids who knew what she was doing told us and we caught her in the act of undoing her work so she had to finish it whether she would or no and when she showed us the robe she had made after she had had it washed its splendour was as that of the sun or moon  then some malicious god conveyed ulysses to the upland farm where his swineherd lives thither pre
achaeans which you would now avenge on me by aiding and abetting these suitors moreover if i am to be eaten out of house and home at all i had rather you did the eating yourselves for i could then take action against you to some purpose and serve you with notices from house to house till i got paid in full whereas now i have no remedy  with this telemachus dashed his staff to the ground and burst into tears every one was very sorry for him but they all sat still and no one ventured to make hi
eezed just as i was speaking this can only mean that all the suitors are going to be killed and that not one of them shall escape furthermore i say and lay my saying to your heart if i am satisfied that the stranger is speaking the truth i shall give him a shirt and cloak of good wear  when eumaeus heard this he went straight to ulysses and said father stranger my mistress penelope mother of telemachus has sent for you she is in great grief but she wishes to hear anything you can tell her 
l gathering thorns to make a fence for the vineyard at the place where the old man had told them he therefore found his father alone hoeing a vine he had on a dirty old shirt patched and very shabby his legs were bound round with thongs of oxhide to save him from the brambles and he also wore sleeves of leather he had a goat skin cap on his head and was looking very woebegone when ulysses saw him so worn so old and full of sorrow he stood still under a tall pear tree and began to weep he doubt
sat among them he caught sight of minerva and went straight to the gate for he was vexed that a stranger should be kept waiting for admittance he took her right hand in his own and bade her give him her spear welcome said he to our house and when you have partaken of food you shall tell us what you have come for  he led the way as he spoke and minerva followed him when they were within he took her spear and set it in the spearstand against a strong bearingpost along with the many ot

 with the sound of their talking  what an exquisitely delicious sleep i have been having said she as she passed her hands over her face in spite of all my misery i wish diana would let me die so sweetly now at this very moment that i might no longer waste in despair for the loss of my dear husband who possessed every kind of good quality and was the most distinguished man among the achaeans  with these words she came down from her upper room not alone but attended by two of her maidens
e form of the famous sea captain dymass daughter who was a bosom friend of nausicaa and just her own age then coming up to the girls bedside like a breath of wind she hovered over her head and said  nausicaa what can your mother have been about to have such a lazy daughter here are your clothes all lying in disorder yet you are going to be married almost immediately and should not only be well dressed yourself but should find good clothes for those who attend you this is the way to get 
nth day diana struck the woman and she fell heavily down into the ships hold as though she were a sea gull alighting on the water so they threw her overboard to the seals and fishes and i was left all sorrowful and alone presently the winds and waves took the ship to ithaca where laertes gave sundry of his chattels for me and thus it was that ever i came to set eyes upon this country  ulysses answered eumaeus i have heard the story of your misfortunes with the most lively interest and pity
 sided with eupeithes they therefore hurried off for their armour and when they had armed themselves they met together in front of the city and eupeithes led them on in their folly he thought he was going to avenge the murder of his son whereas in truth he was never to return but was himself to perish in his attempt  then minerva said to jove father son of saturn king of kings answer me this questionwhat do you propose to do will you set them fighting still further or will you make peace
terly thereafter  then i saw chloris whom neleus married for her beauty having given priceless presents for her she was youngest daughter to amphion son of iasus and king of minyan orchomenus and was queen in pylos she bore nestor chromius and periclymenus and she also bore that marvellously lovely woman pero who was wooed by all the country round but neleus would only give her to him who should raid the cattle of iphicles from the grazing grounds of phylace and this was a hard task the only
e feast and i found them many victims both for sacrifice to the gods and for themselves but on the seventh day we went on board and set sail from crete with a fair north wind behind us though we were going down a river nothing went ill with any of our ships and we had no sickness on board but sat where we were and let the ships go as the wind and steersmen took them on the fifth day we reached the river aegyptus there i stationed my ships in the river bidding my men stay by them and keep guard over

we can both of us deceive upon occasionyou are the most accomplished counsellor and orator among all mankind while i for diplomacy and subtlety have no equal among the gods did you not know joves daughter minervame who have been ever with you who kept watch over you in all your troubles and who made the phaeacians take so great a liking to you and now again i am come here to talk things over with you and help you to hide the treasure i made the phaeacians give you i want to tell you about
 her as she looked upon him and she could not tear her two fair arms from about his neck indeed they would have gone on indulging their sorrow till rosyfingered morn appeared had not minerva determined otherwise and held night back in the far west while she would not suffer dawn to leave oceanus nor to yoke the two steeds lampus and phaethon that bear her onward to break the day upon mankind  at last however ulysses said wife we have not yet reached the end of our troubles i have an unknown 
y converse meanwhile melanthius was again going to the store room to fetch more armour but the swineherd saw him and said to ulysses who was beside him ulysses noble son of laertes it is that scoundrel melanthius just as we suspected who is going to the store room say shall i kill him if i can get the better of him or shall i bring him here that you may take your own revenge for all the many wrongs that he has done in your house  ulysses answered telemachus and i will hold these suitor
 and when she reached the suitors she stood by one of the bearingposts supporting the roof of the cloister holding a veil before her face and with a staid maid servant on either side of her as they beheld her the suitors were so overpowered and became so desperately enamoured of her that each one prayed he might win her for his own bed fellow  telemachus said she addressing her son i fear you are no longer so discreet and well conducted as you used to be when you were younger you had a gr
lack with sand and mud and the men were at their wits ends for fear while we were taken up with this and were expecting each moment to be our last scylla pounced down suddenly upon us and snatched up my six best men i was looking at once after both ship and men and in a moment i saw their hands and feet ever so high above me struggling in the air as scylla was carrying them off and i heard them call out my name in one last despairing cry as a fisherman seated spear in hand upon some jutting rock

 goddess might have pleasure in their beauty then stratius and echephron brought her in by the horns aretus fetched water from the house in a ewer that had a flower pattern on it and in his other hand he held a basket of barley meal sturdy thrasymedes stood by with a sharp axe ready to strike the heifer while perseus held a bucket then nestor began with washing his hands and sprinkling the barley meal and he offered many a prayer to minerva as he threw a lock from the heifers head upon the fire 
d have been no barrow heaped up for him not even when he was dead but he would have been thrown outside the city to dogs and vultures and not a woman would have mourned him for he had done a deed of great wickedness but we were over there fighting hard at troy and aegisthus who was taking his ease quietly in the heart of argos cajoled agamemnons wife clytemnestra with incessant flattery  at first she would have nothing to do with his wicked scheme for she was of a good natural disposition
 winds are raising from every quarter at once i am now safe to perish blest and thrice blest were those danaans who fell before troy in the cause of the sons of atreus would that i had been killed on the day when the trojans were pressing me so sorely about the dead body of achilles for then i should have had due burial and the achaeans would have honoured my name but now it seems that i shall come to a most pitiable end  as he spoke a sea broke over him with such terrific fury that the raft reeled
  i then gave him some more three times did i fill the bowl for him and three times did he drain it without thought or heed then when i saw that the wine had got into his head i said to him as plausibly as i could cyclops you ask my name and i will tell it you give me therefore the present you promised me my name is noman this is what my father and mother and my friends have always called me  but the cruel wretch said then i will eat all nomans comrades before noman himsel

 in his cave nevertheless my courage and wise counsel saved us then and we shall live to look back on all this as well now therefore let us all do as i say trust in jove and row on with might and main as for you coxswain these are your orders attend to them for the ship is in your hands turn her head away from these steaming rapids and hug the rock or she will give you the slip and be over yonder before you know where you are and you will be the death of us  so they did as i told them
nts this and withholds that just as he thinks right for he can do whatever he chooses  as he spoke he cut off the first piece and offered it as a burnt sacrifice to the immortal gods then he made them a drinkoffering put the cup in the hands of ulysses and sat down to his own portion mesaulius brought them their bread the swineherd had brought this man on his own account from among the taphians during his masters absence and had paid for him with his own money without saying anything either
 his two fleet dogs went with him minerva endowed him with a presence of such divine comeliness that all marvelled at him as he went by and the suitors gathered round him with fair words in their mouths and malice in their hearts but he avoided them and went to sit with mentor antiphus and halitherses old friends of his fathers house and they made him tell them all that had happened to him then piraeus came up with theoclymenus whom he had escorted through the town to the place of assembly whe

ke any man look either rich or poor  as he spoke he sat down and telemachus threw his arms about his father and wept they were both so much moved that they cried aloud like eagles or vultures with crooked talons that have been robbed of their half fledged young by peasants thus piteously did they weep and the sun would have gone down upon their mourning if telemachus had not suddenly said in what ship my dear father did your crew bring you to ithaca of what nation did they declare themselves

 other face to face and knew one another they wept for joy and cried aloud till the whole palace rang again thereon circe came up to me and said ulysses noble son of laertes tell your men to leave off crying i know how much you have all of you suffered at sea and how ill you have fared among cruel savages on the mainland but that is over now so stay here and eat and drink till you are once more as strong and hearty as you were when you left ithaca for at present you are weakened both in body a
r helen would never have yielded herself to a man from a foreign country if she had known that the sons of achaeans would come after her and bring her back heaven put it in her heart to do wrong and she gave no thought to that sin which has been the source of all our sorrows now however that you have convinced me by showing that you know all about our bed which no human being has ever seen but you and i and a single maidservant the daughter of actor who was given me by my father on my marriage an
 to them and said we must draw our ship on to the land and hide the ships gear with all our property in some cave then come with me all of you as fast as you can to circes house where you will find your comrades eating and drinking in the midst of great abundance  on this the men would have come with me at once but eurylochus tried to hold them back and said alas poor wretches that we are what will become of us rush not on your ruin by going to the house of circe who will turn u
and my comrades  thus through the livelong day to the going down of the sun we feasted our fill on meat and drink but when the sun went down and it came on dark we camped upon the beach when the child of morning rosyfingered dawn appeared i bade my men on board and loose the hawsers then they took their places and smote the grey sea with their oars so we sailed on with sorrow in our hearts but glad to have escaped death though we had lost our comrades  thence we went on to the aeolian island
  this dream madam replied ulysses can admit but of one interpretation for had not ulysses himself told you how it shall be fulfilled the death of the suitors is portended and not one single one of them will escape  and penelope answered stranger dreams are very curious and unaccountable things and they do not by any means invariably come true there are two gates through which these unsubstantial fancies proceed the one is of horn and the other ivory those that come through the
as i should have founded a city for him in argos and built him a house i should have made him leave ithaca with his goods his son and all his people and should have sacked for them some one of the neighbouring cities that are subject to me we should thus have seen one another continually and nothing but death could have interrupted so close and happy an intercourse i suppose however that heaven grudged us such great good fortune for it has prevented the poor fellow from ever getting home at all
as for taking it to ulysses but the suitors clamoured at him from all parts of the cloisters and one of them said you idiot where are you taking the bow to are you out of your wits if apollo and the other gods will grant our prayer your own boarhounds shall get you into some quiet little place and worry you to death  eumaeus was frightened at the outcry they all raised so he put the bow down then and there but telemachus shouted out at him from the other side of the cloisters and threatene
 and as soon as ulysses had sat down penelope began by saying stranger i shall first ask you who and whence are you tell me of your town and parents  madam answered ulysses who on the face of the whole earth can dare to chide with you your fame reaches the firmament of heaven itself you are like some blameless king who upholds righteousness as the monarch over a great and valiant nation the earth yields its wheat and barley the trees are loaded with fruit the ewes bring forth la
is certain and when a mans hour is come not even the gods can save him no matter how fond they are of him  mentor answered telemachus do not let us talk about it any more there is no chance of my fathers ever coming back the gods have long since counselled his destruction there is something else however about which i should like to ask nestor for he knows much more than any one else does they say he has reigned for three generations so that it is like talking to an immortal t

as soon as i got down to my ship and to the sea shore i rebuked each one of the men separately but we could see no way out of it for the cows were dead already and indeed the gods began at once to show signs and wonders among us for the hides of the cattle crawled about and the joints upon the spits began to low like cows and the meat whether cooked or raw kept on making a noise just as cows do  for six days my men kept driving in the best cows and feasting upon them but when jove the son of sa
 drew our ship on to the sands and got out of her on to the shore where we went to sleep and waited till day should break  then when the child of morning rosyfingered dawn appeared i sent some men to circes house to fetch the body of elpenor we cut firewood from a wood where the headland jutted out into the sea and after we had wept over him and lamented him we performed his funeral rites when his body and armour had been burned to ashes we raised a cairn set a stone over it and at the to

 middle of it there was a fine house built with cut stones in a place that could be seen from far there we found a woman or else she was a goddess working at her loom and singing sweetly so the men shouted to her and called her whereon she at once came down opened the door and invited us in the others did not suspect any mischief so they followed her into the house but i staid where i was for i thought there might be some treachery from that moment i saw them no more for not one of them ever cam
 it would make any one sick to see such a creature at table a fellow like this never won a prize for anything in his life but will go about rubbing his shoulders against every mans door post and begging not for swords and cauldrons like a man but only for a few scraps not worth begging for if you would give him to me for a hand on my station he might do to clean out the folds or bring a bit of sweet feed to the kids and he could fatten his thighs as much as he pleased on whey but he has take
n and drenching its thick plumage in the spray he flew and flew over many a weary wave but when at last he got to the island which was his journeys end he left the sea and went on by land till he came to the cave where the nymph calypso lived  he found her at home there was a large fire burning on the hearth and one could smell from far the fragrant reek of burning cedar and sandal wood as for herself she was busy at her loom shooting her golden shuttle through the warp and singing beautifully
nd a veil to cover her head she at once set herself to think how she could speed ulysses on his way so she gave him a great bronze axe that suited his hands it was sharpened on both sides and had a beautiful olivewood handle fitted firmly on to it she also gave him a sharp adze and then led the way to the far end of the island where the largest trees grewalder poplar and pine that reached the skyvery dry and well seasoned so as to sail light for him in the water then when she had shown h
rpine sent up the ghosts of the wives and daughters of all the most famous men they gathered in crowds about the blood and i considered how i might question them severally in the end i deemed that it would be best to draw the keen blade that hung by my sturdy thigh and keep them from all drinking the blood at once so they came up one after the other and each one as i questioned her told me her race and lineage  the first i saw was tyro she was daughter of salmoneus and wife of cretheus the son of
n his own house but when the will of aegisbearing jove inspired him he and telemachus took the armour and hid it in an inner chamber bolting the doors behind them then he cunningly made his wife offer his bow and a quantity of iron to be contended for by us illfated suitors and this was the beginning of our end for not one of us could string the bownor nearly do so when it was about to reach the hands of ulysses we all of us shouted out that it should not be given him no matter what he might s
riage  sit where you are and eat your victuals in silence or be off elsewhere shouted antinous if you say more i will have you dragged hand and foot through the courts and the servants shall flay you alive  the other suitors were much displeased at this and one of the young men said antinous you did ill in striking that poor wretch of a tramp it will be worse for you if he should turn out to be some godand we know the gods go about disguised in all sorts of ways as people fro
ave by night it was she not he that would have it so as for the day time he spent it on the rocks and on the sea shore weeping crying aloud for his despair and always looking out upon the sea calypso then went close up to him said  my poor fellow you shall not stay here grieving and fretting your life out any longer i am going to send you away of my own free will so go cut some beams of wood and make yourself a large raft with an upper deck that it may carry you safely over the sea i will

ably expect but tomorrow morning you have to shake your own old rags about your body again for we have not many spare cloaks nor shirts up here but every man has only one when ulysses son comes home again he will give you both cloak and shirt and send you wherever you may want to go  with this he got up and made a bed for ulysses by throwing some goatskins and sheepskins on the ground in front of the fire here ulysses lay down and eumaeus covered him over with a great heavy cloak that he kept

le the cup and all the meats went over on to the ground as he smote the earth with his forehead in the agonies of death and he kicked the stool with his feet until his eyes were closed in darkness  then amphinomus drew his sword and made straight at ulysses to try and get him away from the door but telemachus was too quick for him and struck him from behind the spear caught him between the shoulders and went right through his chest so that he fell heavily to the ground and struck the earth with his f

have only one explanation during those days raskolnikov had often recalled passages in that scene with porfiry he could not bear to let his mind rest on it such words such gestures had passed between them they had exchanged such glances things had been said in such a tone and had reached such a pass that nikolay whom porfiry had seen through at the first word at the first gesture could not have shaken his conviction  and to think that even razumihin had begun to suspect the scene in the c

with this letter when nastasya had gone out he lifted it quickly to his lips and kissed it then he gazed intently at the address the small sloping handwriting so dear and familiar of the mother who had once taught him to read and write he delayed he seemed almost afraid of something at last he opened it it was a thick heavy letter weighing over two ounces two large sheets of note paper were covered with very small handwriting  my dear rodya wrote his motherits two months since i

nking over his plan there are no sacred traditions amongst us especially in the educated class avdotya romanovna at the best someone will make them up somehow for himself out of books or from some old chronicle but those are for the most part the learned and all old fogeys so that it would be almost illbred in a man of society you know my opinions in general though i never blame anyone i do nothing at all i persevere in that but weve talked of this more than once before i was so happy indee
ould not entertain the idea of breaking the contract which had just been signed and insisted on the full forfeit money though pyotr petrovitch would be giving him back the flat practically redecorated in the same way the upholsterers refused to return a single rouble of the instalment paid for the furniture purchased but not yet removed to the flat  am i to get married simply for the sake of the furniture pyotr petrovitch ground his teeth and at the same time once more he had a gleam of desperate 
 than he stumbled upon porfiry himself in the passage he was coming in to see him raskolnikov was dumbfounded for a minute but only for one minute strange to say he was not very much astonished at seeing porfiry and scarcely afraid of him he was simply startled but was quickly instantly on his guard perhaps this will mean the end but how could porfiry have approached so quietly like a cat so that he had heard nothing could he have been listening at the door  you didnt expect a vis
oke from sonia  well what am i to do now he asked suddenly raising his head and looking at her with a face hideously distorted by despair  what are you to do she cried jumping up and her eyes that had been full of tears suddenly began to shine stand up she seized him by the shoulder he got up looking at her almost bewildered go at once this very minute stand at the crossroads bow down first kiss the earth which you have defiled and then bow down to all the world and 
rly reminded dounia that he had decided to take her in spite of evil report pyotr petrovitch had spoken with perfect sincerity and had indeed felt genuinely indignant at such black ingratitude  and yet when he made dounia his offer he was fully aware of the groundlessness of all the gossip the story had been everywhere contradicted by marfa petrovna and was by then disbelieved by all the townspeople who were warm in douniaa defence and he would not have denied that he knew all that at the
cane said nikodim fomitch to ilya petrovitch in a civil and friendly tone you are aroused again you are fuming again i heard it on the stairs  well what then ilya petrovitch drawled with gentlemanly nonchalance and he walked with some papers to another table with a jaunty swing of his shoulders at each step here if you will kindly look an author or a student has been one at least does not pay his debts has given an i o u wont clear out of his room and complaints are co

and wet while the wind howled  svidrigalov came to himself got up from the bed and went to the window he felt for the latch and opened it the wind lashed furiously into the little room and stung his face and his chest only covered with his shirt as though with frost under the window there must have been something like a garden and apparently a pleasure garden there too probably there were teatables and singing in the daytime now drops of rain flew in at the window from the trees and bushes
 nonsense only seeing that you are not a student now and have lost your lessons and your clothes and that through the young ladys death she has no need to treat you as a relation she suddenly took fright and as you hid in your den and dropped all your old relations with her she planned to get rid of you and shes been cherishing that design a long time but was sorry to lose the i o u for you assured her yourself that your mother would pay  it was base of me to say that my mother her
and only remember the meaning and besides it was obviously not said of design but slipped out in the heat of conversation so that he tried afterwards to correct himself and smooth it over but all the same it did strike me as somewhat rude and i said so afterwards to dounia but dounia was vexed and answered that words are not deeds and that of course is perfectly true dounia did not sleep all night before she made up her mind and thinking that i was asleep she got out of bed and was wal
 if your spoons should happen to be stolen i wont be responsible i warn you hahaha she laughed turning to raskolnikov and again nodding towards the landlady in high glee at her sally she didnt understand she didnt understand again look how she sits with her mouth open an owl a real owl an owl in new ribbons hahaha  here her laugh turned again to an insufferable fit of coughing that lasted five minutes drops of perspiration stood out on her forehead and her handkerchie
 will come on to rain never mind well put down the hood  svidrigalov was already in the carriage raskolnikov decided that his suspicions were at least for that moment unjust without answering a word he turned and walked back towards the hay market if he had only turned round on his way he might have seen svidrigalov get out not a hundred paces off dismiss the cab and walk along the pavement but he had turned the corner and could see nothing intense disgust drew him away from svidriga
 fist down on the table again  hush hush theyll overhear i warn you seriously take care of yourself i am not joking porfiry whispered but this time there was not the look of old womanish good nature and alarm in his face now he was peremptory stern frowning and for once laying aside all mystification  but this was only for an instant raskolnikov bewildered suddenly fell into actual frenzy but strange to say he again obeyed the command to speak quietly though he was in a perfect p
and laugh and laugh  you are either mad or began zametov and he broke off as though stunned by the idea that had suddenly flashed into his mind  or or what what come tell me  nothing said zametov getting angry its all nonsense  both were silent after his sudden fit of laughter raskolnikov became suddenly thoughtful and melancholy he put his elbow on the table and leaned his head on his hand he seemed to have completely forgotten zametov the silence lasted for
they say so that people come from other villages to hear him he attends school too and laughs till he cries if you hold up a finger to him he will drink himself senselessnot as a regular vice but at times when people treat him like a child and he stole too then without knowing it himself for how can it be stealing if one picks it up and do you know he is an old believer or rather a dissenter there have been wanderers in his family and he was for two years in his village under the

 and to restore the goodhumour of the company and raise herself in their esteem she began apropos of nothing telling a story about an acquaintance of hers karl from the chemists who was driving one night in a cab and that the cabman wanted him to kill and karl very much begged him not to kill and wept and clasped hands and frightened and from fear pierced his heart though katerina ivanovna smiled she observed at once that amalia ivanovna ought not to tell anecdotes in russian the

e conveniently just the other side of the door is sofya semyonovnas table she sat there talking to rodion romanovitch and i sat here listening on two successive evenings for two hours each timeand of course i was able to learn something what do you think  you listened  yes i did now come back to my room we cant sit down here  he brought avdotya romanovna back into his sittingroom and offered her a chair he sat down at the opposite side of the table at least seven feet fr
omething quite different  but they all write like that you know razumihin observed abruptly  have you read it  yes  we showed him rodya we consulted him just now pulcheria alexandrovna began embarrassed  thats just the jargon of the courts razumihin put in legal documents are written like that to this day  legal yes its just legalbusiness languagenot so very uneducated and not quite educatedbusiness language  pyotr petrovitch mak

porfiry petrovitch began again but i cant resist allow me one little question i know i am troubling you there is just one little notion i want to express simply that i may not forget it  very good tell me your little notion raskolnikov stood waiting pale and grave before him  well you see i really dont know how to express it properly its a playful psychological idea when you were writing your article surely you couldnt have helped hehe fancying yourself
dont seem yourself you look and you listen but you dont seem to understand cheer up well talk things over i am only sorry ive so much to do of my own business and other peoples ah rodion romanovitch he added suddenly what all men need is fresh air fresh air more than anything  he moved to one side to make way for the priest and server who were coming up the stairs they had come for the requiem service by svidrigalovs orders it was sung twice a day punctually s

ere  veal vodka savouries  bring me tea and veal  and you want nothing else he asked with apparent surprise  nothing nothing  the ragged man went away completely disillusioned  it must be a nice place thought svidrigalov how was it i didnt know it i expect i look as if i came from a caf chantant and have had some adventure on the way it would be interesting to know who stayed here  he lighted the candle and looked at the room more carefully it w
hat she says she doesnt explain her object she says that it would be best at least not that it would be best but that its absolutely necessary that rodya should make a point of being here at eight oclock and that they must meet i didnt want even to show him the letter but to prevent him from coming by some stratagem with your help because he is so irritable besides i dont understand about that drunkard who died and that daughter and how he could have given the daughter all t

  again they stood for a minute facing each other at last svidrigalovs face changed having satisfied himself that raskolnikov was not frightened at his threat he assumed a mirthful and friendly air  what a fellow i purposely refrained from referring to your affair though i am devoured by curiosity its a fantastic affair ive put it off till another time but youre enough to rouse the dead well let us go only i warn you beforehand i am only going home for a moment to get some m

time she had lowered the revolver in terror and gazed blankly at him so that he might have seized her twice over and she would not have lifted a hand to defend herself if he had not reminded her he recalled how at that instant he felt almost sorry for her how he had felt a pang at his heart  ae damnation these thoughts again i must put it away  he was dozing off the feverish shiver had ceased when suddenly something seemed to run over his arm and leg under the bedclothes he started 
air was soaked with sweat and he was breathing heavily he went rapidly up the stairs walked into his unlocked room and at once fastened the latch then in senseless terror he rushed to the corner to that hole under the paper where he had put the things put his hand in and for some minutes felt carefully in the hole in every crack and fold of the paper finding nothing he got up and drew a deep breath as he was reaching the steps of bakaleyevs he suddenly fancied that something a chain a stud o

 am drinking an awful lot of wine now and talking too much i hope you wont be angry if i mention now that i was beginning to produce the same effect on avdotya romanovna but i was stupid and impatient and spoiled it all avdotya romanovna had several timesand one time in particularbeen greatly displeased by the expression of my eyes would you believe it there was sometimes a light in them which frightened her and grew stronger and stronger and more unguarded till it was hateful to her no need t
uddenly  what asked pyotr petrovitch not catching his words but he received no reply  thats all true zossimov hastened to interpose  isnt it so pyotr petrovitch went on glancing affably at zossimov you must admit he went on addressing razumihin with a shade of triumph and superciliousnesshe almost added young manthat there is an advance or as they say now progress in the name of science and economic truth  a commonplace  no not a com
attering as he asks hehe you are an ironical person come till we meet  i believe we can say goodbye  thats in gods hands muttered porfiry with an unnatural smile  as he walked through the office raskolnikov noticed that many people were looking at him among them he saw the two porters from the house whom he had invited that night to the police station they stood there waiting but he was no sooner on the stairs than he heard the voice of porfiry petrovitch behind him
 among some of these people its not a question of suffering for someones benefit but simply one must suffer if they suffer at the hands of the authorities so much the better in my time there was a very meek and mild prisoner who spent a whole year in prison always reading his bible on the stove at night and he read himself crazy and so crazy do you know that one day apropos of nothing he seized a brick and flung it at the governor though he had done him no harm and the way he thr

rassing especially to a stranger and especially if what you are discussing is in your opinion of far too little importance for such exceptional solemnity but in brief and coherent phrases raskolnikov explained his business clearly and exactly and was so well satisfied with himself that he even succeeded in taking a good look at porfiry porfiry petrovitch did not once take his eyes off him razumihin sitting opposite at the same table listened warmly and impatiently looking from one to the other ever
r own opinion of this mr luzhin who is a connection of mine through my wife if you have only seen him for half an hour or heard any facts about him he is no match for avdotya romanovna i believe avdotya romanovna is sacrificing herself generously and imprudently for the sake of for the sake of her family i fancied from all i had heard of you that you would be very glad if the match could be broken off without the sacrifice of worldly advantages now i know you personally i am convinced of it

 trying not to look at her hastened in  a minute later sonia too came in with the candle set down the candlestick and completely disconcerted stood before him inexpressibly agitated and apparently frightened by his unexpected visit the colour rushed suddenly to her pale face and tears came into her eyes she felt sick and ashamed and happy too raskolnikov turned away quickly and sat on a chair by the table he scanned the room in a rapid glance  it was a large but exceedingly lowpitched roo

now excuse me muttered the stranger frightened by the question and raskolnikovs strange manner and he crossed over to the other side of the street  raskolnikov walked straight on and came out at the corner of the hay market where the huckster and his wife had talked with lizaveta but they were not there now recognising the place he stopped looked round and addressed a young fellow in a red shirt who stood gaping before a corn chandlers shop  isnt there a man who keeps a booth

more by luck than good counsel  you are talking of the murder of the old pawnbroker i believe pyotr petrovitch put in addressing zossimov he was standing hat and gloves in hand but before departing he felt disposed to throw off a few more intellectual phrases he was evidently anxious to make a favourable impression and his vanity overcame his prudence  yes youve heard of it  oh yes being in the neighbourhood  do you know the details  i cant say that but an

 and nearly miscarried with all hands and even the nautilus rising superior to every danger in the sea was about to become intimate with its coral reefs  the torres strait is about thirtyfour leagues wide but its obstructed by an incalculable number of islands islets breakers and rocks that make it nearly impossible to navigate consequently captain nemo took every desired precaution in crossing it floating flush with the water the nautilus moved ahead at a moderate pace like a cetacean

ing i liked to think we might achieve it through persuasion once this voyage was over might not captain nemo consent to set us free in return for our promise never to reveal his existence our word of honor which we sincerely would have kept however this delicate question would have to be negotiated with the captain but how would he receive our demands for freedom at the very outset and in no uncertain terms hadnt he declared that the secret of his life required that we be permanently imprisoned
